All amounts should be in United States dollars, numerical only, and retained to two decimals. If no relevant data can be found, please fill in with N/A.\n\nPlease output the organized data in the format of one Markdown table.\nThe column names in the table are as follows in sequence:\nCompany Name, Listing board, Bloomberg ticker, Listing Date, Initial Offering Price(per share), Total Funds Raised in 2024(million), Revenue in 2024(million), Net Income Attributable to Shareholders(million), R&D Expenses(million)\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily.
