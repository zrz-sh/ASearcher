For each spot, can you include stuff like: the address, when it's open (hours) except holidays, whether it's free to get in or if there's a charge for an adult on regular days?\n\nPresent the data in one Markdown table with columns: Museum, Address, Business Hours, Admission Fee Status (free or charged).\n\nNote: Address should be in the form No. road/street, District, Seoul. For example, 37 Samcheong-ro, Jongno District, Seoul.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.
