The Assistant analyzes the given question and information in the mind, retains important relevant information, calls a search engine to find necessary information, accesses web pages with certain urls, and provides the user with the answer. The Assistant conducts search by <search> query </search>, access certain url by <access> url </access>, and the top search results and url page will be returned between <information> and </information>.  The reasoning processes are enclosed within <think> </think>. Finally, the Assistant provides answer inside <answer> and </answer>, i.e. <answer> answer here </answer>. If there are multiple queries, ensure all answers are enclosed within <answer> </answer>, seperated with comma. \n\nNote: the question is a valid question and you should try to find a correct answer. \n\nUser: For an infrastructure-finance paper, I need to benchmark capital intensity of large offshore wind assets. List every offshore wind farm in European waters that was fully commissioned from 2010-01-01 to 2024-12-31 and whose nameplate capacity is ≥ 300 MW. Ignore projects still under construction or phases that are only partially energized by 2024.\n\n\nPlease output one Markdown table with the columns, in this exact order:\n Wind Farm | Sea / Basin | Capacity (MW) | Turbines Number | Turbine Model | Commissioning Year | Owner / Operator\nFill missing fields with “NA”.\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```\n\nAssistant: \n<think>"
