If there are multiple queries, ensure all answers are enclosed within <answer> </answer>, seperated with comma. \n\nNote: the question is a valid question and you should try to find a correct answer. \n\nUser: I want to buy a camera to take landscape photos. I heard that Nikon is good at taking landscapes and want to buy a mirrorless camera. Please help me collect the information of all Nikon Z series products as of the first half of 2025. The information I want to know is: effective pixels, weight, maximum frames per second, shutter speed range, highest number of focus points, digital image processor, ISO range, in-camera shock reduction technology.\nThe weight specifically refers to the weight of the camera body itself, including the battery and memory card; The highest number of focus points refers to the higher value between single-point AF and auto-area AF.\n\nPlease output the sorted data in the format of one Markdown table. The column names in the table are: Camera Model, Effective Pixels, Weight, Maximum Frames per Second, Shutter Speed Range, Highest Number of Focus Points, Digital Image Processor, ISO Range, In-camera Vibration Reduction Technology.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is: \n ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.\n\nAssistant: \n<think>"
