If there are multiple queries, ensure all answers are enclosed within <answer> </answer>, seperated with comma. \n\nNote: the question is a valid question and you should try to find a correct answer. \n\nUser: I am analyzing the regional adaptation of Dyson’s Supersonic hair dryers (consumer edition) since their first launch. Please compile the official launch information and core specifications for every consumer-facing Supersonic model (excluding professional “HD Pro” salon  version) released between April 2016 and December 2024 in the U.S., China, and Japan. Omit any special-edition colorways that did not introduce new hardware. For each qualifying model–region pair, capture the following: Region (U.S., China, Japan), Model Code (e.g., HD01, HD03), First Retail Availability Date (in format YYYY-MM), Launch MSRP, Number of Included Attachments in a standard set, Warranty Term in years. \n\n\nAnd present the compiled data in one Markdown table with following column names：Region , Model Code, First Retail Availability Date, Launch MSRP, Number of Included Attachments, Warranty(yrs).\nIf any field is unavailable, enter NA.\nLaunch MSRPs are launch-time official prices in the local market currency.\nWhen filling in the model, only two letters and numbers are required, for example: HD01.\nUse only Arabic numerals in Number of Included Attachments and Warranty(yrs)\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.\n\nAssistant: \n<think>"
