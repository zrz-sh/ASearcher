fpawomen'shealth-fresno,FPA Women's Health,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"exact match, response: fresno, target: fresno",fresno,fresno,1.0,"Let's analyze the given pair step by step according to the criterion:

- Reference answer (target): ""165northclarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""
- Response: ""165nclarkst,fresno,ca93701""

Step 1: Semantic comparison  
- Both answers refer to an address with the street number ""165"" and location ""fresno, ca 93701"".
- The difference lies in the street name abbreviation:
  - Target: ""northclarkstreet""
  - Response: ""nclarkst""
  
Step 2: Abbreviation and semantic equivalence  
- ""northclarkstreet"" vs ""nclarkst""  
  - ""n"" very likely is an abbreviation for ""north""
  - ""clarkst"" is a common abbreviation of ""clark street""
- Given that postal addresses commonly use such abbreviations and the meaning is equivalent, this satisfies the criterion that semantics are approximately the same.

Step 3: Conclusion  
- The response points to the same entity as the target.
- The exact string does not need to be identical but the semantics are the same.
- Therefore, the response is correct.
