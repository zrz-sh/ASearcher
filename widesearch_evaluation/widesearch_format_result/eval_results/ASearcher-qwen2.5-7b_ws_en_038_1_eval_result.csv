    - Response says ""glassfront&back"" vs target ""corninggorillaglassvictusfront&back"". Corning Gorilla Glass Victus is a specific type of glass; ""glass"" is broader but acceptable as per criterion.  
    - Both mention front & back glass; matches in semantics.  
- Verdict: acceptable → score 1

- Target: 128gb:799, 256gb:899
- Response: 128gb:$1199, 256gb:$1299, 512gb:$1499
- Response prices much higher and added 512gb not in target.
- Prices differ greatly.
- Prices not approximate.
- Response adds an entity that target does not have.
- Since the given criterion accepts approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, but here prices are different greatly and there is an extra storage option.
- Score = 0

### idx_5
- Target: 128gb:999, 256gb:1099, 512gb:1219, 1tb:1449
- Response: 128gb:$1399, 256gb:$1499, 512gb:$1699
- Price difference about +$400.
- Missing the 1tb size.
- Prices differ greatly; semantics differ significantly.
- Score = 0

    - Response says ""glassfront&back"" vs target ""corninggorillaglassvictusfront&back"". Corning Gorilla Glass Victus is a specific type of glass; ""glass"" is broader but acceptable as per criterion.

    - Response says ""glassfront&back"" vs target ""corninggorillaglassvictusfront&back"". Corning Gorilla Glass Victus is a specific type of glass; ""glass"" is broader but acceptable as per criterion.

- Target: 128gb:799, 256gb:899
- Response: 128gb:$1199, 256gb:$1299, 512gb:$1499
- Response prices much higher and added 512gb not in target.
- Prices differ greatly.
- Prices not approximate.
- Response adds an entity that target does not have.
- Since the given criterion accepts approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, but here prices are different greatly and there is an extra storage option.
- Score = 0

### idx_5
- Target: 128gb:999, 256gb:1099, 512gb:1219, 1tb:1449
- Response: 128gb:$1399, 256gb:$1499, 512gb:$1699
- Price difference about +$400.
- Missing the 1tb size.
- Prices differ greatly; semantics differ significantly.
- Score = 0

---

**Final conclusion:** None of the responses approximate the target answers semantically enough, as the prices are off significantly or important entities are missing.
