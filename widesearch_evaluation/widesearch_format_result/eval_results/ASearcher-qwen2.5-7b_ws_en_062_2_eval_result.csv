Analysis:  
""Chancellor and court"" and ""university council"" are different bodies, so no semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity.  
Score: 0

- Same as idx_2.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""vice-chancellorandfellows""

Analysis:  
Different entities (""vice-chancellor and fellows"" vs ""university council""). No equivalence or approximate similarity.

```",universitycouncil,chancellorandcourt,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair one by one according to the criteria:

Criterion recap:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity (website).  
- No need for exact word-for-word (or exact URL) matching if the difference is superficial (e.g., with or without ""www"" or ""www2"", or http/https, or presence/absence of trailing slash).  
- The URLs should logically point to the same website or organization.

**idx_0:**  
- Response: `https://www.cam.ac.uk/`  
- Target: `https://www.cam.ac.uk/`  
Exact match. Score = 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: `https://www.imperial.ac.uk/`  
- Target: `https://imperial.ac.uk/`  
Difference is ""www."" prefix only. This is likely the same site/entity, only difference is www subdomain, which is common and considered the same. Score = 1

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: `https://www.kcl.ac.uk/`  
- Target: `https://kcl.ac.uk/`  
Again, differing only by the ""www."" prefix. Semantically same entity. Score = 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: `https://www.lse.ac.uk/`  
- Target: `https://lse.ac.uk/`  
Same ""www."" difference. Same entity, score = 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: `https://www.ox.ac.uk/`  
- Target: `https://ox.ac.uk/`  
Same ""www."" difference. Same entity. Score = 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: `https://www.ucl.ac.uk/`  
- Target: `https://ucl.ac.uk/`  
Same ""www."" difference. Same entity. Score = 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: `https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/`  
- Target: `https://warwick.ac.uk/`  
This is interesting since the response has ""www2"" instead of ""www"" or no ""www"". Typically, ""www2"" is a subdomain used for load balancing or specific servers, but generally points to the same entity/organization website. The core domain ""warwick.ac.uk"" matches. According to the criterion, approximate semantics or pointing to same entity is sufficient. So this is acceptable. Score = 1

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word-for-word match.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""universitycouncil""  
- Target: ""theregenthouse""  
Analysis:  
These are clearly different entities. The ""regent house"" and the ""university council"" are distinct bodies in a university context. They do not point to the same entity or have similar semantics.  
Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""presidentandprincipalandcouncil""  
- Target: ""universitycouncil""  
Analysis:  
The response combines ""president and principal and council,"" while target is just ""university council."" The ""university council"" is a specific governing body; the ""president and principal"" are individual roles. Responding with additional entities does not equate to the council alone, and the meaning isn't approximately the same.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""chancellorandcourt""  
- Target: ""universitycouncil""  
Analysis:  
""Chancellor and court"" and ""university council"" are different bodies, so no semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity.  
Score: 0

- Same as idx_2.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4**
