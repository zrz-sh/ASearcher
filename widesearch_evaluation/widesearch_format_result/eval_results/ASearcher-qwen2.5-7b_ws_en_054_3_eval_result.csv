Criterion recap:  
- Semantics approximately the same as target or same entity is enough.  
- A one-year gap between the answer and reference answer is allowed.  
- Score: 0 or 1 only.

Analysis:

- idx_0: response=2010, target=2018  
  Difference = 8 years, which is more than 1 year → score 0

- idx_1: response=2010, target=2016  
  Difference = 6 years → score 0

- idx_2: response=2014, target=2019  
  Difference = 5 years → score 0

- idx_3: response=2010, target=2018  
  Difference = 8 years → score 0

- idx_4: response=2014, target=2017  
  Difference = 3 years → score 0

- idx_5: response=2010, target=2021  
  Difference = 11 years → score 0

- idx_6: response=2010, target=2017  
  Difference = 7 years → score 0

- idx_7: response=2014, target=2014

```",2014,2014,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given that the responses and targets in each pair are state names, the main question is whether the response is semantically the same as the target or points to the same entity.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""colorado""  
Target: ""colorado""  
They are exactly the same. Score = 1.

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""louisiana""  
Target: ""louisiana""  
Exactly the same. Score = 1.

---

**idx_2**  
Response: ""missouri""  
Target: ""missouri""  
Exactly the same. Score = 1.

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""newjersey""  
Target: ""newjersey""  
Although ""newjersey"" is written as a single word without space, it clearly points to the same state entity ""New Jersey"". According to the criterion, approximate semantics pointing to same entity is fine. Score = 1.
