"13thjune,2015",13 Jun 2015,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item one by one:

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

"25thjuly,2015",25 Jul 2015,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item one by one:

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

"14thaugust,2015",14 Aug 2015,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item one by one:

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

"24thaugust,2015",24 Aug 2015,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item one by one:

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

"9thseptember,2015",9 Sep 2015,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item one by one:

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.

"10thdecember,2015",10 Dec 2015,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item one by one:

The criterion is that the response's semantics should approximately match the target (they should point to the same entity or be semantically equivalent). There is no need for a word-for-word match.

For all pairs, the response city and the target city differ (e.g., sanfrancisco vs. philadelphia, minneapolis vs. cologne, etc.). None match in name or clearly refer to the same city or entity.

Since none of the responses correspond in meaning or point to the same entity as the targets, every answer should be scored 0.
