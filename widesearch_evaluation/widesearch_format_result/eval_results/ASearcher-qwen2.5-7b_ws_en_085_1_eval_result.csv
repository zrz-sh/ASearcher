### Pair idx_0  
- **Target:** ""usa/canada""  
- **Response:** ""usa""  
- **Analysis:**  
  The criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics approximate the reference or point to the same entity. The response ""usa"" matches one part of the target ""usa/canada"". It is a subset of the reference answer. Therefore, this should get a full score.

**Score: 1**

### Pair idx_1  
- **Target:** ""france/italy""  
- **Response:** ""france""  
- **Analysis:**  
  The response ""france"" matches part of the target ""france/italy"". Subset matches are sufficient. So, this should get a full score.

**idx_0**

- Target: 118 min
- Response: 2h2m

Convert response to minutes:
2 hours = 120 minutes
2 minutes = 2 minutes
Total = 122 minutes

Response says 122 minutes, target is 118 minutes. Not exactly the same number but close.

Are they approximately the same?

Difference: 4 minutes (122 - 118)

Approximate equivalence could be subjective, but 4 minutes on ~2 hours is a little over 3% difference, arguably small.

However, the criterion says semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Here the response gives a time duration different from the target.

Is ""2h2m"" approximately the same as ""118min""?

118 minutes = 1h58m. So response says 2h2m, target is 1h58m.

They are off by 4 minutes.

Given the criterion is vague (""approximately the same""), and 4 minutes out of 2 hours is minor, this can be considered as approximately the same.

But to be strict, since the question likely requests the exact time, and the response is 4 minutes off, the response is not exactly semantically equivalent.

However, since the criterion allows approximation, this is acceptable.

Convert Response:

1 hour = 60 min; 18 min = 18 min

Target = 76 min

Difference = 2 minutes

Are these approximately the same?

Target says 76 min = 1h16m, response says 1h18m = 78 min

Difference of 2 minutes out of roughly 1 hour 16 minutes (4% difference)

Given the criterion of approximate meaning, this should be acceptable.
