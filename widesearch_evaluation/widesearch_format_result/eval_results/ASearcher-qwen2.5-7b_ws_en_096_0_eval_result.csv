### idx_0  
- Response: ""stackedcmos""  
- Target: ""expeed7imageprocessor""  
Analysis:  
""Stacked CMOS"" is a type of sensor technology, whereas ""expeed7 image processor"" is a processor model by Nikon. These refer to different hardware components. Meaning differs and they do not point to the same entity.  
Score: 0

### idx_1  
- Response: ""dualexpeed6""  
- Target: ""dualexpeed6digitalimageprocessors""  
Analysis:  
""DualExpeed6"" and ""dualexpeed6digitalimageprocessors"" semantically refer to the same entity - dual image processors of model Expeed6. The response shortens the phrase but clearly points to the same thing.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_2  
- Response: ""expeed6""  
- Target: ""dualexpeed6digitalimageprocessors""  
Analysis:  
Response points to one Expeed6 processor, target says dual Expeed6 processors. Response does not cover the ""dual"" part which is a significant aspect of the target. However, ""expeed6"" is part of the target name. If the question is about the processor used, outputting the processor type alone may be considered partially correct but does not reflect the dual nature. The criterion states approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough. ""DualExpeed6"" is a pair of Expeed6 processors. So ""expeed6"" points to part of the entity but omits ""dual"". Omission of ""dual"" makes this incomplete, because it changes the meaning.  
Given that the criterion considers approximate semantics to be sufficient, this may be borderline. But ""dual"" is critical here (dual processors significantly differ from single). So response only answers half.  
As scoring is rigid (0 or 1), and ""dual"" is significant, I would give 0.  
Score: 0

### idx_3  
- Response: ""expeed6""

The criterion states approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough. ""DualExpeed6"" is a pair of Expeed6 processors. So ""expeed6"" points to part of the entity but omits ""dual"". Omission of ""dual"" makes this incomplete, because it changes the meaning.  
Given that the criterion considers approximate semantics to be sufficient, this may be borderline. But ""dual"" is critical here (dual processors significantly differ from single). So response only answers half.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = '493.0'  
  'nan' does not semantically approximate or point to '493.0'. Hence, score = 0.

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = '493.0'  
  Same logic as idx_0. Score = 0.

- idx_2: response = 'nan', target = '273.0'  
  Same logic. Score = 0.

- idx_3: response = 'nan', target = '299.0'  
  Same logic. Score = 0.

- idx_4: response = 'nan', target = '273.0'  
  Same logic. Score = 0.

No response matches its target or even approximates it.

Final scoring JSON:

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 0,
    ""idx_1"": 0,
    ""idx_2"": 0,
    ""idx_3"": 0,
    ""idx_4"": 0
}
```",273.0,nan,0.0,"Let's analyze each item one by one based on the grading criterion:

Criterion summary:
- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- The score is 0 if they do not.
- No need for exact word-for-word correspondence.
- Scoring is either 0 or 1.

Items to evaluate:

1. idx_0:
   - Response: ""nan""
   - Target: ""5-axisimagesensorshift""
   - Analysis: ""nan"" has no semantic meaning and does not approximate or point to the same entity as ""5-axisimagesensorshift.""
   - Score: 0

2. idx_1:
   - Response: ""nan""
   - Target: ""5-axisimagesensorshift""
   - Same as above.
   - Score: 0

3. idx_2:
   - Response: ""nan""
   - Target: ""5-axisimagesensorshift""
   - Same as above.
   - Score: 0

4. idx_3:
   - Response: ""nan""
   - Target: ""5-axisimagesensorshift""
   - Same as above.
   - Score: 0

5. idx_4:
   - Response: ""nan""
   - Target: ""imagesensor5-axisshift""
   - The target here is the same entity as in previous - ""5-axis image sensor shift"" but differently formatted.
   - ""nan"" is still no meaningful response.
   - Score: 0

Final scores:

```",imagesensor5-axisshift,nan,0.0,"Let's analyze and score each pair step-by-step:

**Given information:**

- The responses are all ""nan"" (not a number or not an actual answer).
- The targets (the standard answers) are different ISO ranges, e.g., ""iso64-25600"", ""iso100-51200"", etc.
- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Scoring is either 0 or 1, and responses not matching the reference semantically should get 0.

### Analysis:

- idx_0: response = ""nan"", target = ""iso64-25600""
  - ""nan"" does not semantically equal or represent ""iso64-25600""
  - Score = 0

- idx_1: response = ""nan"", target = ""iso64-25600""
  - Same as above.
  - Score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""nan"", target = ""iso100-51200""
  - Response not semantically equal
  - Score = 0

- idx_3: response = ""nan"", target = ""iso100-64000""
  - Response not semantically equal
  - Score = 0

- idx_4: response = ""nan"", target = ""iso100-51200""
  - Response not semantically equal
  - Score = 0

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given all responses are ""nan"" (not applicable/empty/absent?):  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: some detailed text describing shutter speed ranges, increments, bulb modes, remote bulb, and sometimes x200.

Step-by-step analysis per idx:

1. idx_0:  
   - Response: ""nan""  
   - Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""  
   Since the response is ""nan"" (no info), it does not approximately convey the same semantics or refer to the same entity as the target.  
   Score: 0

2. idx_1:  
   - Response: ""nan""  
   - Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""  
   Same reasoning as above: the response is empty or ""nan"" → no matching semantics.  
   Score: 0

3. idx_2:  
   - Response: ""nan""  
   - Target: Same as idx_1  
   Score: 0

4. idx_3:  
   - Response: ""nan""  
   - Target: ""1/8000−30s(incrementof1/3ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""  
   Response is empty, target is detailed → no match.  
   Score: 0

5. idx_4:  
   - Response: ""nan""  
   - Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb,x200""  
   Response empty → no match.  
   Score: 0

Final scoring: all zero.
