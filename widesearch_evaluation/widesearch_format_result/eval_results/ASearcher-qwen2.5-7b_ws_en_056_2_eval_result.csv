,,1,1,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_9: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_10: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_12: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_13: adamlevine,aliciakeys,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_14: adamlevine,kellyclarkson,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_15: adamlevine,johnlegend,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton,beberexha(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Summary:**

- idx_0: 0  
- idx_1, idx_2, idx_3: 0

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye  
  Target is ""timeaftertime"" (different song)

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,2,2,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_15: adamlevine,johnlegend,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton,beberexha(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Summary:**

- idx_0: 0  
- idx_1, idx_2, idx_3: 0

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye  
  Target is ""timeaftertime"" (different song)

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,3,3,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_9: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_10: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_15: adamlevine,johnlegend,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton,beberexha(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Summary:**

- idx_0: 0  
- idx_1, idx_2, idx_3: 0

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes

- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

This is consistent with the grading guideline and the presence/absence of entities in the target answers.","adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton","adamlevine,blakeshelton",0.0,"exact not match, response: 2015-06-27, target: 2013-12-17",2013-12-17,2015-06-27,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Summary:**

- idx_0: 0  
- idx_1, idx_2, idx_3: 0

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

,,6,6,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

,,7,7,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

,,8,8,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

,,9,9,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

,,10,10,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:

  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

,,11,11,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)

- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

,,12,12,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""

,,13,13,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Summary:**

- idx_0: 0  
- idx_1, idx_2, idx_3: 0

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""

,,14,14,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes

- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO

- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)

- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""

,,15,15,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes

- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""

,,16,16,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes

- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""

,,17,17,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes

- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)

- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

---

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye  
  Target is ""timeaftertime"" (different song)

,,18,18,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

- idx_7 to idx_9: same, response ""nan"", target different artist names → 0.

- idx_10 to idx_25: same logic, responses ""nan"", targets artist names or groups → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""

,,19,19,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,20,20,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye  
  Target is ""timeaftertime"" (different song)

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,21,21,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye  
  Target is ""timeaftertime"" (different song)

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,22,22,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye  
  Target is ""timeaftertime"" (different song)

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,23,23,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_15: adamlevine,johnlegend,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton,beberexha(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Stepwise check:**

- idx_0: response = ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  Response is song ""somebodythatiusedtoknow"" by Gotye  
  Target is ""timeaftertime"" (different song)  
  => No match (different songs) => 0

- idx_1: response = ""gottabesomebody(b.o.b)"", target = ""complicated""  
  Response ""gottabesomebody"" by B.o.B

From idx_4 through idx_25, response is consistent: ""somebodythatiusedtoknow(gotye)""

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,24,24,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_9: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_12: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_13: adamlevine,aliciakeys,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_14: adamlevine,kellyclarkson,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_15: adamlevine,johnlegend,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton,beberexha(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,25,25,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_9: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_10: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_12: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_13: adamlevine,aliciakeys,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_14: adamlevine,kellyclarkson,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_15: adamlevine,johnlegend,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton,beberexha(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.

,,26,26,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item carefully:

**Grading Criteria/Notes:**
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are NOT necessary to be mentioned in the response for a correct answer.

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

The response for all idx entries is the same:  
`response = ""adamlevine,blakeshelton""`

The targets vary, each listing 4-5 people including those two plus others.

Since the response only contains two names: ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton""

- For an answer to be scored ""1"" it should be approximately the same as the target or point to the same entities.
- Because the target contains additional names beyond ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton,"" the response is only a partial answer.
- However, the criteria say it is sufficient if the semantics point to the same entity, and ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" are always included in the target.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary, so those can be ignored.

Therefore:
- As all targets include ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton"" (except some cases where these two do NOT show up - need to verify),
- Let's check if targets always contain ""adamlevine"" and ""blakeshelton.""

Check targets by idx:  
- idx_0: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → contains both  
- idx_1: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_2: same → yes  
- idx_3: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_4: same as idx_0 → yes  
- idx_5: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_6: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_7: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton → yes  
- idx_8: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton → yes

- idx_15: adamlevine,johnlegend,kellyclarkson,blakeshelton,beberexha(comebackstage) → yes  
- idx_16: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine is missing here → NO  
- idx_17: kellyclarkson,nickjonas,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_18: kellyclarkson,gwenstefani,johnlegend,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_19: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,nickjonas,blakeshelton,kelseaballerini(guest) → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_20: kellyclarkson,johnlegend,arianagrande,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_21: johnlegend,gwenstefani,camilacabello,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_22: kellyclarkson,chancetherapper,niallhoran,blakeshelton → adamlevine missing → NO  
- idx_23: johnlegend,gwenstefani,niallhoran,rebamcentire,dan+shay(guest) → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO (blakeshelton missing here as well)  
- idx_24: johnlegend,dan+shay,chancetherapper,rebamcentire → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO  
- idx_25: michaelbublé,gwenstefani,rebamcentire,snoopdogg → adamlevine and blakeshelton missing → NO

Conclusion per idx:

- idx_0 to idx_15 → target contains adamlevine and blakeshelton  
  response contains just these two → consistent with criteria → score=1  
- idx_16 to idx_22 → response contains adamlevine and blakeshelton but target is missing adamlevine  
  response mentions an entity not in target → different semantics → score=0  
- idx_23 to idx_25 → neither adamlevine nor blakeshelton both appear together in target (idx_23 missing blakeshelton)  
  response mentions entities not in target → score=0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The response includes ""carsondaly"" which matches the first entity in the target, but ""christinaaguilera"" does not match ""alisonhaislip"".  
- According to the criterion, the presence of ""carsondaly"" at least partially matches the target list, even though the second name is different.  
- The target lists two entities; the response lists two entities but only one matches.  
- Is ""christinaaguilera"" equivalent or approximately the same as ""alisonhaislip""? No.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity; here only one entity matches. However, since the response partially matches the target, does partial match count as full or zero? The instruction only requires the semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since the response doesn’t point to the same second entity, it is not fully correct. But is at least partial match enough? The instruction doesn't specify partial credit, and the scoring is binary (0 or 1). Since the response doesn't capture the full target semantics (second entity is different), score=0.

---

**idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:**  
Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- ""carsondaly"" matches.  
- ""christinaaguilera"" vs. ""christinamilian"" are different names.  
- These are two different celebrities. So no approximate or same entity in second name.  
- So response partially correct (first entity), but second entity wrong. Score=0.

---

**idx_4 to idx_25:**  
Target: ""carsondaly""  
Response: ""carsondaly,christinaaguilera""  
- The target only requires ""carsondaly"" (single entity).  
- The response lists ""carsondaly"" plus an extra entity ""christinaaguilera"" which is additional but first entity is correct.  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity, and there's no mention that extra information invalidates the answer.  
- So response contains all entities required in the target answer and more. The extra entity doesn't contradict correctness.  
- Therefore, the response can be considered correct (score=1).

**Criterion**:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Since all the responses are ""nan"" and targets are names of individuals or groups, these clearly do not match semantically.  
- Because the responses are all ""nan"" (not a valid answer), and the targets are specific artist names, the responses do not correspond to the target answers.  
- Therefore, each response should score 0.

---

**Detailed per-item judgment**:

- idx_0: response - ""nan"" vs target - ""nan""  
  Even though target is ""nan"", ""nan"" means no answer or missing, so no useful content; score 0.

- idx_1 to idx_4: Same situation, both response and target ""nan"" → score 0.

- idx_5: response ""nan"", target ""chrismartin"" → no match → 0.

- idx_6: response ""nan"", target ""taylorswift"" → 0.

The grading criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

Here we are given pairs of (response, target). For each, the response is a string in lowercase, with no spaces, containing a song title and sometimes an artist in parentheses. The target is a string indicating the expected song title (also no spaces, lowercase).

We need to check if the response (the answer) correctly identifies the target (the standard answer song title or entity). If response and target refer to the same song or entity, score 1; else 0.

- Scoring rule:  
  The response must contain all the music pieces listed in the target answer (reference answer). Partial matching or mentioning only one music piece when multiple are required results in score 0.  
  The semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entities.  
  The scoring is 0 or 1 only.

**Summary:**  
All responses either mention only one song different from multiple songs in the target or they fail to include all songs listed in the reference answer. According to the grading criterion (""If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference answer, all must be included""), none of the responses fully answer the target. Therefore, all scores are 0.
