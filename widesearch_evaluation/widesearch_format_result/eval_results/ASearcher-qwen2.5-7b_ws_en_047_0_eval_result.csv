- Response for all is ""nan"".

According to the criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" Here response is ""nan"" which is typically understood as ""not a number"" or no meaningful answer, so it does not point to the same entity or approximate the reference answer’s semantics.

Therefore, the responses do not meet the criteria and should be scored 0.

- The expected answer is in 'target'.
- The response is in 'response'.
- Scoring can only be 0 or 1.
- It's sufficient if meanings are the same or pointing to the same entity.
- Difference of 1 day or less (if applicable) is acceptable.

**idx_0**  
- Response: '12'

- Target: '1'  
- They are exactly the same.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**  
- Response: '2'  
- Target: '1'  
- They differ by 1. Since difference of 1 or less is acceptable, this counts as correct.
