**idx_2**  
- Target: ""karwaiwong""  
- Response: ""wongkar-wai""  
Same as idx_0, same evaluation applies.

Score: 1

**idx_3**  
- Target: ""anglee""  
- Response: ""anglee""  
Exact match.

Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
- Target: ""ercheng""  
- Response: ""chenger""  
Analysis: Different strings. The response seems like a transposition or rearrangement of letters but does not clearly point to the same entity as ""ercheng."" Since the criterion requires approximate semantic equivalency or pointing to the same entity, and this response appears incorrect (the name is different, and no indication that ""chenger"" equals ""ercheng""), this should be marked incorrect.

Score: 0

**idx_5**  
- Target: ""felixchong""  
- Response: ""felixchong""  
Exact match.
