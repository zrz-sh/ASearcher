,,4:03.84,4:03.84,0.0,"Let's analyze each item step by step according to the provided criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0
- idx_7: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_8: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_9: '-' vs 'lászlócseh' → no match → 0
- idx_10: '-' vs 'lucamarin' → no match → 0
- idx_11: '-' vs 'lucamarin' → no match → 0
- idx_12: '-' vs 'paulbiedermanni' → no match → 0
- idx_13: '-' vs 'paulbiedermanni' → no match → 0
- idx_14: '-' vs 'wupeng' → no match → 0
- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

Since all responses are '-', none match or approximate the target answer semantics or point to the target entity.

,,1:42.96,1:42.96,0.0,"Let's analyze each item step by step according to the provided criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0
- idx_7: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_8: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_9: '-' vs 'lászlócseh' → no match → 0
- idx_10: '-' vs 'lucamarin' → no match → 0

- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

Since all responses are '-', none match or approximate the target answer semantics or point to the target entity.

,,1:52.03,1:52.03,0.0,"Let's analyze each item step by step according to the provided criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0
- idx_7: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_8: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0

- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

Since all responses are '-', none match or approximate the target answer semantics or point to the target entity.

,,0:50.58,50.45,0.0,"Let's analyze each item step by step according to the provided criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0

- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

,,0:50.58,50.58,0.0,"Let's analyze each item step by step according to the provided criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0
- idx_7: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_8: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_9: '-' vs 'lászlócseh' → no match → 0

- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

Since all responses are '-', none match or approximate the target answer semantics or point to the target entity.

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0
- idx_7: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0
- idx_8: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0

- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0

- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0
- idx_7: '-' vs 'shunwang' → no match → 0

- idx_15: '-' vs 'laszlocseh' → no match → 0
- idx_16: '-' vs 'evgenykorotyshkin' → no match → 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Given:
- All responses are '-' (dash), which is essentially an empty or placeholder answer.
- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_3: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_4: '-' vs 'andrewlauterstein' → no match → 0
- idx_5: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0
- idx_6: '-' vs 'tamáskenderesi' → no match → 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

- The target answers are different names (usernames or identifiers).

Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response '-' vs target 'ryanlochte' → '-' provides no semantic match or pointing to 'ryanlochte' → score 0
- idx_1: '-' vs 'petervanderkaay' → no match → 0
- idx_2: '-' vs 'takeshimatsuda' → no match → 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.
