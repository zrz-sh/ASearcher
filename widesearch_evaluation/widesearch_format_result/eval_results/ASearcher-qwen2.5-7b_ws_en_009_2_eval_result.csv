,,mamediaandcommunications,MA Media & Communications,1.0,"exact match, response: £22,000, target: £22,000","£22,000","£22,000",0.0,"For idx_0:

- Target answer:  
  - 3 items:  
    1. introduction to media and communications theory (30 credits)  
    2. dissertation (60 credits)

- Response: ""coremodules(90credits)""  

Analysis according to the criterion:  
- The response does not mention the introduction to media and communications theory, nor a dissertation. Instead, it says ""coremodules(90credits)"", which semantically is different and does not point to the same entities/topics/terms as the target.  
- Although the credits sum up to 90, the structure and the names of the modules in the response are not at all aligned with the reference answer.  
- According to the criterion, semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Here, they do not.  

Therefore: score = 0.

60credits",coremodules(90credits),1.0,"Analysis:

- Standard answer for idx_0: ""30+60""  
- Response for idx_0: ""90""

According to the grading criteria:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or they point to the same entity.  
- The model's output ""90"" is the calculated sum of ""30+60"", so it is acceptable.

Therefore, the response correctly corresponds to the standard answer in meaning.

Final score for idx_0: 1

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",30+60,90,1.0,"Let's analyze the response against the target according to the grading criterion:

- Target: ""6.5witha6.5inwritingandnoelementlowerthan6.0""  
  This indicates a score of 6.5, with a 6.5 in writing, and no element lower than 6.0.

- Response: ""6.5""  
  The response gives the overall score but does not explicitly mention the writing score or the lowest element score.

According to the criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity without requiring word-for-word match.  
- The response clearly gives the overall score ""6.5,"" matching the first part of the target.  
- The additional details in the target (writing 6.5, no element lower than 6.0) are not explicitly stated but implied in the final overall score 6.5. The response does not contradict the target.

Given that semantics are approximately the same and refer to the same entity (score 6.5), the response is considered fully correct.

Final scoring:

```json
{
  ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",6.5witha6.5inwritingandnoelementlowerthan6.0,6.5,1.0,"Analyzing the response in detail:

- Standard answer (target): ""1yearfull-time""
- Response: ""1year""

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.

Analysis:
- The response mentions ""1year"" while the standard answer is ""1yearfull-time.""
- The key information ""1year"" is present in both.
- The term ""full-time"" is missing from the response, but depending on context, ""1year"" can generally imply duration.
- The criterion states approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- The response captures the duration (""1 year"").
- Without ""full-time,"" the response is less specific, but since the criterion is lenient, it's acceptable.

Conclusion: The response points to the same entity (duration of one year) and is approximately the same meaning. According to criterion, this is sufficient.
