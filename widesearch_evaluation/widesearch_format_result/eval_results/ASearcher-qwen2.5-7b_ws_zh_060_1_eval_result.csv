- Standard answer: ""1m""
- Response: ""1mtokens""

Analysis:
- The response includes ""1m"" as the core quantity, which matches the target's key numerical value.
- The appended ""tokens"" is additional but does not change the core meaning and still refers to the same entity (quantity).
- According to the criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应"" (The semantic meaning can be roughly the same or point to the same entity, exact word by word is not required).
- Therefore, the response sufficiently matches the standard answer.

Score: 1

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",1m,1mtokens,1.0,"First, analyze the given pair:

- Standard answer (target): ""谷歌""
- Response: ""google""

The criterion says: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
Translation: ""The meaning should be roughly the same as the reference answer, or point to the same entity. Exact word-to-word matching is not required.""

""谷歌"" is the Chinese name for the company ""Google"". The response ""google"" is the English name of the same entity.

Since they point to the same entity, according to the criterion, this counts as a correct answer.

Therefore, the score is 1.
