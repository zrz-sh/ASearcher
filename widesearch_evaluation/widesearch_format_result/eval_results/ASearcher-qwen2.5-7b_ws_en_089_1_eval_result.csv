- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes. We consider the answer correct (score=1) if the response sufficiently matches the target, i.e., it contains the same or very close price points, or a subset/superset that does not obviously contradict the target. If there are prices wildly off or missing major elements, or the prices differ significantly, then score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes. We consider the answer correct (score=1) if the response sufficiently matches the target, i.e., it contains the same or very close price points, or a subset/superset that does not obviously contradict the target. If there are prices wildly off or missing major elements, or the prices differ significantly, then score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12  
target: firstdualsimsupport,smarthdr  
Response mentions A12 chip, iOS12 but no dual SIM or smart HDR. Missing main target features. Score=0.

**idx_22**  
response: 5gcapability,ceramicshield,a14bionicchip,ios14  
target: 5gsupport,magsafemagneticcharging  
Response includes 5G support; ceramic shield is additional but not contradicting; target mentions MagSafe magnetic charging missing. However, 5G is main feature. Score=1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes. We consider the answer correct (score=1) if the response sufficiently matches the target, i.e., it contains the same or very close price points, or a subset/superset that does not obviously contradict the target. If there are prices wildly off or missing major elements, or the prices differ significantly, then score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""

Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""

Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes. We consider the answer correct (score=1) if the response sufficiently matches the target, i.e., it contains the same or very close price points, or a subset/superset that does not obviously contradict the target. If there are prices wildly off or missing major elements, or the prices differ significantly, then score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore

Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""

Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**

Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12  
target: firstdualsimsupport,smarthdr  
Response mentions A12 chip, iOS12 but no dual SIM or smart HDR. Missing main target features. Score=0.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12  
target: firstdualsimsupport,smarthdr  
Response mentions A12 chip, iOS12 but no dual SIM or smart HDR. Missing main target features. Score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes. We consider the answer correct (score=1) if the response sufficiently matches the target, i.e., it contains the same or very close price points, or a subset/superset that does not obviously contradict the target. If there are prices wildly off or missing major elements, or the prices differ significantly, then score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12  
target: firstdualsimsupport,smarthdr  
Response mentions A12 chip, iOS12 but no dual SIM or smart HDR. Missing main target features. Score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**

Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**

Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes. We consider the answer correct (score=1) if the response sufficiently matches the target, i.e., it contains the same or very close price points, or a subset/superset that does not obviously contradict the target. If there are prices wildly off or missing major elements, or the prices differ significantly, then score=0.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12  
target: firstdualsimsupport,smarthdr  
Response mentions A12 chip, iOS12 but no dual SIM or smart HDR. Missing main target features. Score=0.

**idx_18**  
response: larger6.5-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12  
target: firstdualsimsupport,smarthdr  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_19**

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Response does not mention glass back or wireless charging, only water resistance. Missing main feature. Score=0.

**idx_14**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios11  
target: glassbackwithwirelesscharging  
Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12  
target: firstdualsimsupport,smarthdr  
Response mentions A12 chip, iOS12 but no dual SIM or smart HDR. Missing main target features. Score=0.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
The responses are lists of prices separated by slashes.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

**idx_13**

response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""

Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1

- Criterion: Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Deviations allowed if reasonable and factual.

---

**idx_0**  
response: firstmulti-touchscreen,appstore  
target: revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign  
Analysis: Response mentions first multi-touchscreen and appstore; target mentions revolutionary model with touchscreen design. Multi-touchscreen implies touchscreen design, which is the key revolutionary model feature. Minor deviation but acceptable. Score=1.

**idx_1**  
response: fasterprocessor,3gconnectivity  
target: supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched  
Analysis: Response includes 3G connectivity and faster processor; target mentions 3G support and appstore launched. 3G support matches; app store missing but 3G match is enough, showing main feature correct. Score=1.

**idx_2**  
response: fasterprocessor,improvedcamera,3gs  
target: firstintroductionofvoicecontrol  
Analysis: Voice control is the main feature targeted; the response does not mention voice control. Just faster processor, improved camera, 3GS, which is a model name but does not imply voice control. No semantic match. Score=0.

**idx_3**  
response: retinadisplay,facetime,ios4  
target: retinadisplay,firstledflash  
Analysis: Both mention retina display correctly. Response includes FaceTime, target includes first LED flash. LED flash is not mentioned, FaceTime is new but not in target. Missing LED flash is partial mismatch but retina display match is strong. Since LED flash is important, missing it and adding FaceTime (not mentioned) indicates partial mismatch. However, criterion says approximate semantic equivalence is acceptable. But LED flash is missing. Probably not enough to reject since Retina Display is main feature here. Score=1.

**idx_4**  
response: fastera5chip,retinadisplay,siri  
target: introductionofsirivoiceassistant  
Analysis: Target is Siri introduction; response includes Siri. Also faster A5 chip and retina display which is correct for that generation. Siri is explicitly mentioned, key feature matched. Score=1.

**idx_5**  
response: larger4-inchdisplay,m7motioncoprocessor,ios6  
target: newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim  
Analysis: Target is lightning connector and nano-SIM first use; response mentions larger display, M7 motion coprocessor, ios6 but no lightning or nano-SIM. No semantic overlap. Score=0.

**idx_6**  
response: 64-bita7chip,touchid,ios7  
target: firstintroductionoftouchidfingerprintsensor  
Analysis: Response mentions touchid and A7 chip, ios7. Target explicitly says introduction of touchid fingerprint sensor. Matches well. Score=1.

**idx_7**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,applepay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response mentions apple pay, larger screen, ios8; target mentions first NFC and apple pay support. NFC missing but apple pay is included, which implies NFC presence logically. Score=1.

**idx_8**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,ios8  
target: firstsupportfornfcandapplepay  
Analysis: Response only mentions bigger screen and ios8, but no mention of apple pay or NFC. Missing key features. Score=0.

**idx_9**  
response: larger4.7-inchand5.5-inchdisplays,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Analysis: Response includes 3D touch explicitly, matching target. Good. Score=1.

**idx_10**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,3dtouch,ios9  
target: introductionof3dtouchtechnology  
Same as above, 3D touch is present. Score=1.

**idx_11**  
response: larger4.7-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Analysis: Response mentions water and dust resistance (ios10), but no mention of headphone jack removal. Partial match for water/dust but misses important headphone jack removal. Criterion says approximate semantics - since headphone jack removal is important (major change), missing is significant. Score=0.

**idx_12**  
response: larger5.5-inchdisplay,wateranddustresistance,ios10  
target: removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance  
Same reasoning as idx_11. Missing headphone jack removal. Score=0.

Same as above. Score=0.

**idx_15**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,faceid,ios11  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response mentions faceid and OLED display which corresponds to full-screen design. Semantics close enough. Score=1.

**idx_16**  
response: larger6.1-inchlcddisplay,faceid,ios12  
target: full-screendesignwithfaceid  
Response includes faceid but LCD display instead of OLED, but full screen is main point, faceid is key feature. LCD vs OLED not crucial here. Score=1.

**idx_17**  
response: larger5.8-incholeddisplay,a12bionicchip,ios12

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response only mentions one of the two target prices; partial but enough to represent part of the target. Since criterion says ""approx the same or pointing to same entity""  
Given only one price vs two prices, this is partial but still the $199 is a main price in the set, no contradictory info. So it can be accepted → score=1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""$199""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Only one price from three target prices. Though partial, it matches one price; no contradictory info. Accept → score=1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has one extra price ($399), but includes all target prices. Overshooting can be acceptable as it includes full target set. Approximates same set → score=1

**idx_4**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_5**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has an extra price ($512). Includes all target prices. Accept → score=1

**idx_6**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Same as idx_5 → score=1

**idx_7**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Difference in the middle price: 279 vs 299 (difference of $20). Since ""approx the same"" is allowed, and two of three prices are the same, and price difference is minor → Accept → score=1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_9**  
Response: ""$199/$279/$399/$512""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response has 4 prices where target has 3; 279 is close to 299, one extra price $512. Includes all target prices except the 299 replaced by 279. Minor price difference accepted → score=1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""$299/$399/$499/$649""  
Target: ""$299/$399/$499""  
Extra price $649 but includes all target prices → score=1

**idx_11**  
Response: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_12**  
Response: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Target: ""$769/$869/$969""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""$699/$799""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
One price matches ($699), the other differs by $50 (799 vs 849). The criterion specifies approximate semantics accepted. $50 is a moderate difference but prices differ distinctly. Let's see if this is acceptable:

- Two prices total. 799 vs 849 is different tiers, but possibly minor difference accepted. 
- Given the criterion is generous, it's arguably close enough.

Hence accept → score=1

**idx_14**  
Response: ""$799/$899""  
Target: ""$799/$949""  
Similar to idx_13: second price is 899 vs 949, $50 diff. Accept → score=1

**idx_15**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Response has 3 prices, target 2 prices. 1099 and 1149 differ by $50, close. 1199 extra price, 999 exact. Partial overlap.

Since criterion allows approximate or partial overlaps pointing to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_16**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$949""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Prices differ by about $50 each for second and third prices. Same count and approximate values. Accept → score=1

**idx_17**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Approximate sets. 1099 vs 1149 differs $50, 1199 vs 1349 differs $150, slightly larger gap but still close enough as approximate.

Still points to same entity → accept → score=1

**idx_18**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Second price 1199 vs 1249 ($50 diff), third price 1299 vs 1449 ($150 diff). Approximate sets → accept → score=1

**idx_19**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
Differences $50 for 2nd and 3rd price. Approximate → accept → score=1

**idx_20**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1199""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Same as idx_17 → accept → score=1

**idx_21**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299""  
Target: ""$1099/$1249/$1449""  
Same as idx_18 → accept → score=1

**idx_22**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1049/$1199""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Response has one additional price and prices are generally a bit higher than target prices. 899 vs 849, 1049 vs 949, 1199 is extra price. The sets differ in length and price range is higher.

Though the criterion is approximate, here the sets differ significantly in the latter prices.

Given the discrepancies, this is less close than prior cases.

Because the response includes prices not corresponding to target and the price range is shifted upward significantly, this leans towards incorrect.

Hence score=0

**idx_23**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299""  
Response contains target set plus an extra price ($1399). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_24**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399""  
Response has an extra price ($1299) but includes all target prices → accept → score=1

**idx_25**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_26**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only difference last price: 1399 vs 1499 ($100 difference). Approximate match → accept → score=1

**idx_27**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response missing $1599, includes rest. Acceptable → score=1

**idx_28**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Exact match → score=1

**idx_29**  
Response: ""$599/$699""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Prices differ by large margins. Response prices are significantly lower than target prices. Differs in semantics → score=0

**idx_30**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Only last price differs by $100. Approximate → score=1

**idx_31**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$1099/$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Missing last price (1599). Acceptable → score=1

**idx_32**  
Response: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Response prices are mostly higher than target prices. Also count differs. Not the same or approximate sets pointing to same entities.

Hence score=0

**idx_33**  
Response: ""$699/$799/$899""  
Target: ""$899/$999/$1199""  
Response prices all lower and differ from target. No approximate match → score=0

**idx_34**  
Response: ""$1099/$1199/$1299/$1399""  
Target: ""$999/$1099/$1299/$1499""  
Prices differ slightly but mostly overlapping sets. Accept → score=1

**idx_35**  
Response: ""$1199/$1299/$1399/$1499""  
Target: ""$1199/$1399/$1599""  
Response has an extra price (1299), target has 1599 instead of 1499. The 1599 missing from response and 1499 extra close by. Missing target 1599 price and has extra 1499.

Since 1599 vs 1499 difference is $100 and 1299 is an extra, sets are somewhat close.

Given the approximations allowed, we accept → score=1
