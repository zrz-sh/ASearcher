- Response includes an extra ""1TB"" which is not in target. Is that a problem?  
- Criterion does not penalize extra information as long as the entities match or are semantically equivalent for target items.

All responses match their targets perfectly or refer to the same entity.

```json

    ""idx_0"": 1,
    ""idx_1"": 1,
    ""idx_2"": 1,
    ""idx_3"": 1
}
```",oppo,oppo,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze and judge each item according to the criterion:

The criterion says:
- The response should be roughly semantically equivalent or point to the same entity.
- Exact wording is not necessary.

Now for each idx:

**idx_0**  
- response: ""7.85英寸""  
- target: ""7.85英寸""  
They are exactly the same.  
Score: 1

**idx_1**  
- response: ""7.6英寸""  
- target: ""8.01英寸""  
These are different values. The response is 7.6, the target is 8.01.  
Are these roughly the same or pointing to the same entity?  
No, 7.6 and 8.01 differ by 0.41 inches which is a considerable difference for sizes. They do not refer to the same value/entity.  
Score: 0

**idx_2**  
- response: ""6.7英寸""  
- target: ""6.74英寸""  
Values differ slightly by 0.04 inches.  
This is very close and essentially the same size. Semantic meaning is the same (screen size / length about 6.7 inches).  
Score: 1

**idx_3**  
- response: ""7.1英寸""  
- target: ""7.10英寸""  
Difference is minimal and both denote 7.1 inches effectively.  
Same meaning.  
Score: 1

Final results in JSON:

```",7.10英寸,7.1英寸,0.0,"Let me analyze each pair step by step according to the criterion:

Criterion: The response should have approximately the same meaning or refer to the same entity; exact word-for-word matching is not required.

    ""idx_2"": 0,

Criterion:  
- The response should have the same or roughly the same meaning as the target (reference answer).
- The response and target pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- No need for exact match word-by-word, but the semantic content must be equivalent.
