Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
That means the answer should be semantically the same or refer to the same entity. Here, the question concerns years, so the answer year should be the same as the target year or close enough to refer to the same entity. Since the criterion is somewhat loose (""大致相同"" means approximately the same or pointing to the same entity), we need to consider if the answer is close or clearly the same as the target. However, years usually are specific, so presumably the exact year or very close year may count as correct. But the criterion says ""approximate"" or ""same entity"". Since these are specific years, it's most reasonable that only exact matches are accepted as correct (score 1). Otherwise, this would be ambiguous and subjective. The criterion states it does NOT require exact matching but approximately the same or pointing to the same entity - but since these are years, ""approximate"" might allow a difference of only 1 year? Let's check each pair carefully.  

If the target is 2007, answer 2007 => obviously correct (1).  
If target 2013, answer 2013 => 1.  

For others, e.g., target 2006, answer 2008: two years differ by 2 years. Is that still considered the ""same entity"" for years? Probably not, because years are specific markers. The difference between 2006 and 2008 is not ""approximately the same"" for a specific year, unless the context states a range or approximate year is acceptable. But the criterion only says approximate semantic or same entity. Since the entities are years, difference by 1 year might be accepted? Let's decide:

- Difference 1 year: probably 1 (approximate).  
- Difference more than 1 year: probably 0.

That means the answer should be semantically the same or refer to the same entity. Here, the question concerns years, so the answer year should be the same as the target year or close enough to refer to the same entity. Since the criterion is somewhat loose (""大致相同"" means approximately the same or pointing to the same entity), we need to consider if the answer is close or clearly the same as the target. However, years usually are specific, so presumably the exact year or very close year may count as correct. But the criterion says ""approximate"" or ""same entity"". Since these are specific years, it's most reasonable that only exact matches are accepted as correct (score 1). Otherwise, this would be ambiguous and subjective.

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
That means the answer should be semantically the same or refer to the same entity. Here, the question concerns years, so the answer year should be the same as the target year or close enough to refer to the same entity. Since the criterion is somewhat loose (""大致相同"" means approximately the same or pointing to the same entity), we need to consider if the answer is close or clearly the same as the target. However, years usually are specific, so presumably the exact year or very close year may count as correct. But the criterion says ""approximate"" or ""same entity"". Since these are specific years, it's most reasonable that only exact matches are accepted as correct (score 1). Otherwise, this would be ambiguous and subjective. The criterion states it does NOT require exact matching but approximately the same or pointing to the same entity - but since these are years, ""approximate"" might allow a difference of only 1 year? Let's check each pair carefully.  

If the target is 2007, answer 2007 => obviously correct (1).  
If target 2013, answer 2013 => 1.  

For others, e.g., target 2006, answer 2008: two years differ by 2 years. Is that still considered the ""same entity"" for years? Probably not, because years are specific markers. The difference between 2006 and 2008 is not ""approximately the same"" for a specific year, unless the context states a range or approximate year is acceptable. But the criterion only says approximate semantic or same entity. Since the entities are years, difference by 1 year might be accepted? Let's decide:

- Difference 1 year: probably 1 (approximate).  
- Difference more than 1 year: probably 0.

Let's apply that logic.

Now item by item:

idx_0: response=2008, target=2006 → difference 2 years → score 0  
idx_1: response=2009, target=2007 → difference 2 years → score 0  
idx_2: response=2007, target=2007 → exact → score 1  
idx_3: response=2013, target=2013 → exact → score 1

idx_5: response=2002, target=2020 → difference 18 years → score 0

idx_8: response=2014, target=2015 → difference 1 year → score 1

,,straykids,Stray Kids,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: The response's semantics should be roughly the same as the standard answer or point to the same entity. Exact word-for-word matching is not necessary.

- idx_0: response = ""sm"", target = ""sm"" → exactly the same entity → score = 1  
- idx_1: response = ""sm"", target = ""sm"" → same → 1  
- idx_2: response = ""sm"", target = ""sm"" → same → 1
