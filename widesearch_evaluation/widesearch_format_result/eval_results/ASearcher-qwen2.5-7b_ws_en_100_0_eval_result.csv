**idx_3**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""
- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""

Analysis: Response only says the court name, without ""judge"" qualifier. Target explicitly says ""judge"". However, since response points to the court itself, without specifying position, it is less specific.

Still, since the reference is for the position ""judge of that court,"" response naming the court alone does not explicitly mention the judge position.

But per criterion, approximate semantics is sufficient; ""judge of the court"" vs. just ""court"" is less than ideal but points to the same entity.

This is borderline. However, because the response is just the name of the court without mentioning the role as a judge, it might be considered incomplete.

Given criterion allows for approximate semantics or same entity; since the response names the court where the target explicitly says judge of that court, I think this is acceptable as same entity in context.

Difference: response only says the court, target says chief judge of that court.

Response is less specific, it only identifies the court, not the judge position or chief status.

Per criterion, ""approximate semantics are sufficient,"" or pointing to the same entity.

Response points to the court; Target points to the chief judge position on the court.

Is that sufficient?

Probably no. ""Judge"" vs. ""Chief Judge"" is a clear difference.

Similarly, ""court"" vs. ""chief judge of court"" is a difference, losing the role/position.

Therefore, response is less specific and could be considered incomplete, does not indicate the position (judge or chief judge), only the court.

Hence, score 0.

Response is less specific, it only identifies the court, not the judge position or chief status.

Per criterion, ""approximate semantics are sufficient,"" or pointing to the same entity.

Response points to the court; Target points to the chief judge position on the court.

Is that sufficient?

Probably no. ""Judge"" vs. ""Chief Judge"" is a clear difference.

Similarly, ""court"" vs. ""chief judge of court"" is a difference, losing the role/position.

Therefore, response is less specific and could be considered incomplete, does not indicate the position (judge or chief judge), only the court.

Hence, score 0.

Analysis: Response only says the court name, without ""judge"" qualifier. Target explicitly says ""judge"". However, since response points to the court itself, without specifying position, it is less specific.

Still, since the reference is for the position ""judge of that court,"" response naming the court alone does not explicitly mention the judge position.

But per criterion, approximate semantics is sufficient; ""judge of the court"" vs. just ""court"" is less than ideal but points to the same entity.

This is borderline. However, because the response is just the name of the court without mentioning the role as a judge, it might be considered incomplete.

Given criterion allows for approximate semantics or same entity; since the response names the court where the target explicitly says judge of that court, I think this is acceptable as same entity in context.

- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""

Analysis: Response only says the court name, without ""judge"" qualifier. Target explicitly says ""judge"". However, since response points to the court itself, without specifying position, it is less specific.

Still, since the reference is for the position ""judge of that court,"" response naming the court alone does not explicitly mention the judge position.

But per criterion, approximate semantics is sufficient; ""judge of the court"" vs. just ""court"" is less than ideal but points to the same entity.

This is borderline. However, because the response is just the name of the court without mentioning the role as a judge, it might be considered incomplete.

Given criterion allows for approximate semantics or same entity; since the response names the court where the target explicitly says judge of that court, I think this is acceptable as same entity in context.

**idx_7**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsforthefirstcircuit""
- Target: ""chiefjudge,u.s.courtofappeals(1stcircuit)""

Difference: response only says the court, target says chief judge of that court.

Response is less specific, it only identifies the court, not the judge position or chief status.

Per criterion, ""approximate semantics are sufficient,"" or pointing to the same entity.

Response points to the court; Target points to the chief judge position on the court.

Is that sufficient?

Probably no. ""Judge"" vs. ""Chief Judge"" is a clear difference.

Similarly, ""court"" vs. ""chief judge of court"" is a difference, losing the role/position.

Therefore, response is less specific and could be considered incomplete, does not indicate the position (judge or chief judge), only the court.

Hence, score 0.

- Response: ""chiefjusticeoftheminnesotasupremecourt""
- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""

**idx_3**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""
- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""

Analysis: Response only says the court name, without ""judge"" qualifier. Target explicitly says ""judge"". However, since response points to the court itself, without specifying position, it is less specific.

Still, since the reference is for the position ""judge of that court,"" response naming the court alone does not explicitly mention the judge position.

But per criterion, approximate semantics is sufficient; ""judge of the court"" vs. just ""court"" is less than ideal but points to the same entity.

This is borderline. However, because the response is just the name of the court without mentioning the role as a judge, it might be considered incomplete.

Given criterion allows for approximate semantics or same entity; since the response names the court where the target explicitly says judge of that court, I think this is acceptable as same entity in context.

**idx_7**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsforthefirstcircuit""
- Target: ""chiefjudge,u.s.courtofappeals(1stcircuit)""

Difference: response only says the court, target says chief judge of that court.

Response is less specific, it only identifies the court, not the judge position or chief status.

Per criterion, ""approximate semantics are sufficient,"" or pointing to the same entity.

Response points to the court; Target points to the chief judge position on the court.

Is that sufficient?

Probably no. ""Judge"" vs. ""Chief Judge"" is a clear difference.

Similarly, ""court"" vs. ""chief judge of court"" is a difference, losing the role/position.

Therefore, response is less specific and could be considered incomplete, does not indicate the position (judge or chief judge), only the court.

Hence, score 0.

**idx_0**

- Response: ""chiefjusticeoftheminnesotasupremecourt""
- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""

Analysis: Completely different courts and different positions (chief justice of a state supreme court vs. judge of a federal court of appeals). Not semantically same or pointing to the same entity.

Score: 0

---

**idx_1**

- Response: ""judgeofthearizonacourtofappeals""
- Target: ""judgeofthearizonacourtofappealsfordivisionone""

Analysis: Target is more specific (division one) but response indicates the same general court. They semantically refer to the same entity broadly. Good enough.

Score: 1

---

**idx_2**

- Response: ""associatejusticeofthesupremecourt""
- Target: ""associatejustice,u.s.supremecourt""

Analysis: Both indicate the same position, just formatted differently but same meaning.

Score: 1

---

**idx_3**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""
- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""

Analysis: Response only says the court name, without ""judge"" qualifier. Target explicitly says ""judge"". However, since response points to the court itself, without specifying position, it is less specific.

Still, since the reference is for the position ""judge of that court,"" response naming the court alone does not explicitly mention the judge position.

But per criterion, approximate semantics is sufficient; ""judge of the court"" vs. just ""court"" is less than ideal but points to the same entity.

This is borderline. However, because the response is just the name of the court without mentioning the role as a judge, it might be considered incomplete.

Given criterion allows for approximate semantics or same entity; since the response names the court where the target explicitly says judge of that court, I think this is acceptable as same entity in context.

Score: 1

**idx_4**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsfortheninthcircuit""
- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsfortheninthcircuit""

Same logic as above. Responder says court but not judge explicitly.

Per criterion, it's acceptable.

Score: 1

**idx_5**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""
- Target: ""judge,u.s.courtofappeals(d.c.circuit)""

Approximate semantics, same entity referenced.

Score: 1

**idx_6**

- Response: ""judgeoftheu.s.courtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""
- Target: ""judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit""

Same meaning, slightly different shorthand for U.S., but the same.

Score: 1

---

**idx_7**

- Response: ""unitedstatescourtofappealsforthefirstcircuit""
- Target: ""chiefjudge,u.s.courtofappeals(1stcircuit)""

Difference: response only says the court, target says chief judge of that court.

Response is less specific, it only identifies the court, not the judge position or chief status.

Per criterion, ""approximate semantics are sufficient,"" or pointing to the same entity.

Response points to the court; Target points to the chief judge position on the court.

Is that sufficient?

Probably no. ""Judge"" vs. ""Chief Judge"" is a clear difference.

Similarly, ""court"" vs. ""chief judge of court"" is a difference, losing the role/position.

Therefore, response is less specific and could be considered incomplete, does not indicate the position (judge or chief judge), only the court.

Hence, score 0.
