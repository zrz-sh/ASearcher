cameronhamilton&laurenspeed,Lauren Speed & Cameron Hamilton,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs. target), according to the criterion:  
- The semantics should approximately be the same or point to the same entity (seasonX or seasonX written in digits or words equivalently).  
- The response is a digit (e.g., ""1"", ""2"", etc.) while the target is the word ""season"" plus the digit (e.g., ""season1""). Since they both signify the same identifier of the season (just the response is a digit corresponding exactly to the number in the target), this should be accepted as semantically equivalent.
