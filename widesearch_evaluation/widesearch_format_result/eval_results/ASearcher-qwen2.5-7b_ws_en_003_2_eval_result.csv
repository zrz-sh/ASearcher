idx_0:  
- Response: ""olympic""  
- Target: ""olympics""  
Analysis: The response ""olympic"" and the target ""olympics"" refer essentially to the same entity (the Olympic Games). The difference is singular vs. plural form or a slight variation in wording, but semantically they point to the same event.  
Judgment: This satisfies the criterion of approximate semantic equivalence.

Judgment: Fully acceptable.

idx_2:

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""1st""

- ""gremaudmathilde"" vs ""funanakayama"" - no match.

Overall, only the first name is arguably related, but the other two pairs are unrelated.
