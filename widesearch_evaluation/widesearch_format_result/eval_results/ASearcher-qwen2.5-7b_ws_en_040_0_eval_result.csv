**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.

Same as idx_0

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.

""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0

""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""

Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.

""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_21:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_12  
Score: 1  

**idx_22:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_25:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match  
Score: 1  

**idx_26:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""games""  
""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_28:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""games""  
""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.

Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1

Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_25:**

**idx_26:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""games""  
""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_28:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""games""  
""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.

Same as idx_0

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.

""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0

Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1

""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.

""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_21:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_12  
Score: 1  

**idx_22:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_25:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match  
Score: 1  

**idx_26:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""games""  
""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_28:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""games""  
""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.

""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_21:**

Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_25:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match  
Score: 1  

**idx_26:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""games""  
""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_28:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""games""  
""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.

Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.

Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0

Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_25:**

**idx_26:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""games""  
""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.

""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_21:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_12  
Score: 1  

**idx_22:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_25:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match  
Score: 1  

**idx_26:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""games""  
""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_28:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""games""  
""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.

Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.

- The response is acceptable if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
- Only 0 or 1 scores are allowed.

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.  
Score: 1  

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.  
Score: 1  

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""music""  
""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_20:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_21:**

Same as idx_12  
Score: 1  

**idx_22:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Same as idx_14  
Score: 0  

**idx_23:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
Different entities; messaging is communication, photo&video is media content categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_24:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0  
Score: 1  

**idx_25:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match  
Score: 1  

**idx_26:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""games""  
""Social"" and ""games"" are different entities, not equivalent.  
Score: 0  

**idx_27:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Email is a communication tool, socialmedia is a broader platform category. Not sufficient approximate equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_28:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""games""  
""Video"" and ""games"" are different categories. Not equivalent.  
Score: 0

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""social"" is an acceptable shorthand or related term to ""socialmedia"" (which presumably stands for ""social media""). Same semantic field.  
Score: 1  

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""dating""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""dating"" and ""messaging"" are different; ""dating"" can involve messaging but is a different category. No exact semantic match or equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""video"" and ""socialmedia"" are different categories, although video content can be part of social media, they represent different entities/categories.  
Score: 0  

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""streaming"" (usually video/music streams) is different from ""social media"". Not the same entity or close semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0  

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""communication""  
Video can be a medium of communication, but ""video"" alone is not necessarily synonymous with communication as a whole; communication is broader. Slight overlap but not same entity.  
Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity — probably insufficient here.  
Score: 0  

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""reading""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""reading"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Reading is passive, messaging is active communication. No semantic equivalency.  
Score: 0  

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same as idx_0.  
Score: 1  

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""social"" and ""messaging"" are different concepts. Social is broad; messaging is specific communication. Not semantically equivalent enough.  
Score: 0  

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""communication""  
Messaging is a type of communication, so messaging is an acceptable subset and can be seen as approximate equivalence.  
Score: 1  

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""social"" and ""entertainment"" are different semantic categories. Not equivalent.

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a feature or subset of social media, but since ""socialmedia"" is a broader category, ""messaging"" as a response is acceptable as approximate equivalence or pointing to the same domain.

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Exact match.

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Different categories; ""social"" is broad, ""messaging"" is specific communication. Not same entity.  
Score: 0  

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same rationale as idx_12.  
Score: 1  

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Social"" can imply communication in social contexts, but social is broader than communication. Interaction has some overlap but not perfect equivalence. Given criterion allows approximate similarity, might accept.  
But ""social"" alone does not necessarily mean ""communication."" Slightly ambiguous. Since criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, I lean to accept.  
Score: 1  

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""email""  
Target: ""messaging""  
Email is a form of messaging, a specific type of it. Thus acceptable under approximate equivalence.

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""video""  
Target: ""photo&video""  
""video"" is part of ""photo&video"" category. Acceptable approximate equivalence.

""Social"" and ""music"" are different categories. Not equivalent.

```",music,music,1.0,"Let's analyze and judge each pair (response vs. target) according to the criteria:

- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.
- Scoring: 1 if response correctly matches or semantically corresponds to target, otherwise 0.
