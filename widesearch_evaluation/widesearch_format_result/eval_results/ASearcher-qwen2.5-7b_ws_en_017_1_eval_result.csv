General notes based on the criterion:  
- The question concerns whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.  
- The response given is always ""nan"", meaning no actual answer content is provided.  
- The target (standard answer) all clearly indicate hunting is prohibited in the given parks or areas, except occasionally noting adjacent areas where hunting may be allowed with permits or other regulations.

Given the criteria that the semantics (allowed/prohibited) must be approximately the same, since the responses for all entries are ""nan"" (no answer), none of the responses properly convey the meaning of hunting being prohibited, which is essential.

Therefore, since the responses do not provide any information and are effectively empty or missing answers, the score for every idx should be 0.

General notes based on the criterion:  
- The question concerns whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.  
- The response given is always ""nan"", meaning no actual answer content is provided.  
- The target (standard answer) all clearly indicate hunting is prohibited in the given parks or areas, except occasionally noting adjacent areas where hunting may be allowed with permits or other regulations.

Given the criteria that the semantics (allowed/prohibited) must be approximately the same, since the responses for all entries are ""nan"" (no answer), none of the responses properly convey the meaning of hunting being prohibited, which is essential.

Therefore, since the responses do not provide any information and are effectively empty or missing answers, the score for every idx should be 0.

General notes based on the criterion:  
- The question concerns whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.  
- The response given is always ""nan"", meaning no actual answer content is provided.  
- The target (standard answer) all clearly indicate hunting is prohibited in the given parks or areas, except occasionally noting adjacent areas where hunting may be allowed with permits or other regulations.

Given the criteria that the semantics (allowed/prohibited) must be approximately the same, since the responses for all entries are ""nan"" (no answer), none of the responses properly convey the meaning of hunting being prohibited, which is essential.

Therefore, since the responses do not provide any information and are effectively empty or missing answers, the score for every idx should be 0.
