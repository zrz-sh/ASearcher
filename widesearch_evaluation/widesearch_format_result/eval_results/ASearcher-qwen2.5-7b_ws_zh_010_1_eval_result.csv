- **idx_0**:  
  - Standard answer: '/'  
  - Response: 'nan'  
  - According to the criterion, the response should have the same semantic meaning or point to the same entity as the standard answer. Here, the standard answer is '/', a symbol or character. The response is 'nan', which typically means ""not a number"" or a placeholder for missing data. They do not share the same meaning or point to the same entity.

- **idx_1**:  
  - Standard answer: '/'  
  - Response: 'nan'

- **idx_2**:  
  - Standard answer: '胜' (which means ""win"" or ""victory"")

   - 参考答案target： '/'  
   - 回答response： '/'  
   - 两者完全相同，语义一致，无疑问。  
   - 评分：1

2. idx_1:

- 标准答案和响应内容都比较简单，主要是“response”和“target”的对应关系。
- 评分标准非常宽松，只要语义相同大致或指向同一个实体即可，且评分为0或1。

### idx_0
- response: ""/""
- target: ""/""
- 两者完全相同，语义也指向同一实体。

判断：完全正确，记1分。

### idx_1
- response: ""/""
- target: ""15-21,21-11,22-20""
- response只有一个“/”，target是具体的一串编号，显然语义不一致，也不指向相同实体。

判断：错误，记0分。

### idx_2
- response: ""/""
- target: ""21-12,21-10""
- 同idx_1，response只有“/”，target是编号列表，不相符。

判断：错误，记0分。

   - 根据评分标准，语义大致相同或指向实体一致即可。  
   - “超级1000”属于羽毛球的超级系列赛的一个等级，属于超级系列赛中的最高级别。  
   - “超级系列赛”是一个宽泛的分类，包含“超级1000”。  
   - 可以认为回答指向的实体范围更大，但仍包括标准答案实体。  
   - 符合大致语义一致的要求，应给分1。

2. idx_1:

- 只要语义大致相同或者指向的实体一致，即可得分1。
- 不需要字字对应，故“冠军”与“冠军”完全相同应得1分。
- 如果“冠军”与“32强”或“4强”所指的实体不同，则不一致，得0分。

具体分析：

1. idx_0  
   - response: “冠军”

- Responses that are semantically the same or point to the same entity as the target answer are fully correct.

- The response exactly matches the target.  
- Therefore, score = 1
