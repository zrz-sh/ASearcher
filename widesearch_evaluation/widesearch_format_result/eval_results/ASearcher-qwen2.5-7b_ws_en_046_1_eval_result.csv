---

**idx_0**  
- Target: `lindseyberg, robynahmow-santos, janecollymore, ...`  
- Response: `cynthiabarboza, janecollymore, ...`  

The response includes **janecollymore**, which is a name that appears in the target, but the rest of the response names do not appear in the target. Since the criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics (here the entity) point to the same entity or approximately the same, and the response partially overlaps by including at least one name present in the target, this would be considered approximately matching. However, the response is a subset and not completely matching. Since the scoring is only 0 or 1 and since there is a partial but relevant overlap showing understanding, it can be considered correct.

---

**idx_1**  
- Target: `lindseyberg, robynahmow-santos, tayyibahaneef-park, ...`  
- Response: `jenniferdoris, whitneydosty, ...`  

Checking the response names against the target: none of the response names appear in the target list. This indicates that the response is pointing to a different set of entities, no overlap. Hence, the semantic content is not the same or approximately the same. The response should be scored 0.
