,,hightechnologyhighschool,High Technology High School,0.0,"number not convertable, response: None, target: 6.0",6.0,NULL,1.0,key_match,0.0,"exact not match, response: 27, target: 24",24,27,1.0,"Analysis:

- Target answer: ""grades9-12""
- Response: ""9-12""

Comparison:

- The target specifies grades 9 through 12.
- The response ""9-12"" conveys the same range, just the prefix ""grades"" is omitted.
- According to the grading criterion, exact wording is not necessary as long as the semantics are approximately the same or they point to the same entity.
- ""9-12"" clearly means the same grade levels as ""grades9-12"".

Conclusion: The response is semantically equivalent to the target.

Score: 1

---

### Given:

- Standard answer idx_0: '1'  
- Response idx_0: '1'  
- Criterion:  
  > It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

### Analysis for idx_0:

- The response exactly matches the target answer.  
- Semantics are the same (indeed the same string).  
- No deduction applies.  
- According to the criteria, this response is completely correct.

---

### Final scoring:

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",1,1,1.0,"Analysis:

- idx_0 standard answer: ""newjersey""
- idx_0 response: ""newjersey""

Comparison according to the criterion:

- The response exactly matches the target answer.
- The semantics are identical.
- The criterion states semantics approximately the same or the same entity is sufficient.
- Here, it's an exact match, so should be full credit.
