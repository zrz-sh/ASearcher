Criterion summary:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word-for-word match, but the values must represent the same or very close amounts.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: $379.99  
- Target: $379.99  
- Same value with exact match → fully correct.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1:**  
- Response: $399.99  
- Target: $379.99  
- Different value, $20 difference on approximately $380—does not point to the same entity/value.  
- According to the criterion, close amounts but not ""approximately the same"" semantically for price?  
- The criterion says ""approximately the same"" or same entity.  
- Here, it is unclear if the price is ""approximately the same."" $399.99 vs $379.99 is a difference of $20, ~5.26% difference.  
- Usually for such pricing, this difference might be considered not the same. The criterion is ambiguous. However, since the figure changed, the semantics do not match exactly.  
- The criterion says ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.""  
- The entity is the price, but the price is different. It could still be considered different.  
- If ""approximately the same"" is lenient, it may be accepted. But as the question requires only 0 or 1, it is better to be strict.  
- So assign score 0.

**idx_2:**  
- Response: $479.99  
- Target: $399.99  
- Difference is $80, around 20% difference. Definitely not approximately the same → score 0.

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ￥3990  
- Target: ¥2990  
- Both use the Yen currency symbol in different styles (￥ vs ¥) but the amount is 3990 vs 2990, $1000 difference.  
- Currency unit is the same, but the amount is considerably different (~33% difference).  
- The criterion says semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity → here the price changed significantly.  
- Thus, score 0.

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ¥39800  
- Target: ¥45000  
- Both use the same currency symbol, but values are 39800 vs 45000.  
- Difference 5200, around 11.5% difference.  
- According to the criterion, this is likely not approximately the same price.  
- Score 0.
