""create a charter for compassion"" vs. ""the charter for compassion"" - same entity referred, conceptually equal (the charter for compassion is likely a known entity, ""create a charter for compassion"" is similar phrase).  
Criterion says approximate semantics or same entity is enough.

**idx_0**  
Response: 'mywish:manufacturedlandscapesandgreeneducation'  
Target: 'mywish:manufacturedlandscapesandgreeneducation'  
Exact same => score 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: 'nan' (not an answer)  
Target: 'mywish:acallforopen-sourcearchitecture'  
Response does not match or approximate target => score 0

---

**idx_2**  
Response: 'mywish:buildtheencyclopediaoflife'  
Target: 'mywish:buildtheencyclopediaoflife'  
Exact same => score 1

---

**idx_3**  
Response: 'mywish:createacharterforcompassion'  
Target: 'mywish:thecharterforcompassion'  

Check semantic equivalence:  
""create a charter for compassion"" vs. ""the charter for compassion"" - same entity referred, conceptually equal (the charter for compassion is likely a known entity, ""create a charter for compassion"" is similar phrase).  
Criterion says approximate semantics or same entity is enough.  

=> score 1

No match => score 0

---

**idx_8**  
Response: 'mywish:buildaschoolinthecloud'  
Target: 'buildaschoolinthecloud'  
The prefix 'mywish:' doesn't change the core phrase or semantic meaning. They both point to the same entity ""build a school in the cloud"".  
Criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to same entity.  
So score 1

Criterion summary:

**idx_0**  
Response: ""longbeach,ca""  
Target: ""monterey""  
Analysis: ""longbeach"" and ""monterey"" are different places. They do not point to the same entity or have approximately the same semantic meaning.  
Score: 0

**idx_1**  
Response: ""nan""  
Target: ""monterey""  
Analysis: ""nan"" is presumably a placeholder for no answer. It is not addressing the target answer ""monterey."" No semantic equivalence or entity matching.  
Score: 0

Target: ""monterey""
