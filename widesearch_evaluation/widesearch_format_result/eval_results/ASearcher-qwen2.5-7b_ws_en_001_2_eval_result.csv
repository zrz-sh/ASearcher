,,engineering&technology,Physical Sciences,massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion:**
- The response must have approximately the same semantics as the target or point to the same entity.
- The month and day must be correct.
- ""The month and day must be correct"" implies that the response should mention the date correctly; time or year is not mandatory unless specified in the target.
- The responses all are ""regulardecision"" which is not a date and doesn't contain any month or day information.

---

### Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response = ""regulardecision"", target = ""january6""
  - Response has no date information, so month and day are incorrect → 0

- idx_1: response = ""regulardecision"", target = ""october15,6pm(bst)""

In short: None of the responses mention the correct month and day as required by the criterion. So all scores are 0.

**Criterion:**
- The response must have approximately the same semantics as the target or point to the same entity.

**Criterion:**
- The response must have approximately the same semantics as the target or point to the same entity.

**Criterion:**
- The response must have approximately the same semantics as the target or point to the same entity.

,,socialsciences&management,Engineering and Technology,massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion:**
- The response must have approximately the same semantics as the target or point to the same entity.
- The month and day must be correct.
- ""The month and day must be correct"" implies that the response should mention the date correctly; time or year is not mandatory unless specified in the target.
- The responses all are ""regulardecision"" which is not a date and doesn't contain any month or day information.

---

### Analysis item by item:

- idx_0: response = ""regulardecision"", target = ""january6""
  - Response has no date information, so month and day are incorrect → 0

- idx_1: response = ""regulardecision"", target = ""october15,6pm(bst)""

In short: None of the responses mention the correct month and day as required by the criterion. So all scores are 0.
