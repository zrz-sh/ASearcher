,,2008,2008,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the grading criteria:

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_14:**  
- Response: ""veterinarian""  
- Target: ""veterinarian; founder project street vet""  
Exact match.  
=> Score: 1

- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.

Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.

**idx_8**  
Response: gives young people with disabilities a brighter future  
Target: free therapy, education & mobility aids for disabled children

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'georgewashingtonuniversity'  
  No response given. No match → score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'cavitestateuniversity'

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'georgewashingtonuniversity'  
  No response given. No match → score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'cavitestateuniversity'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_6: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  The target is also 'nan' (no target), response is 'nan' (no response). Since nothing to match, arguably correct (no answer expected). It's reasonable to give score = 1 here.

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

  No response given. No match → score = 0

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'georgewashingtonuniversity'  
  No response given. No match → score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'cavitestateuniversity'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_6: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  The target is also 'nan' (no target), response is 'nan' (no response). Since nothing to match, arguably correct (no answer expected). It's reasonable to give score = 1 here.

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'georgewashingtonuniversity'  
  No response given. No match → score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'cavitestateuniversity'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_2: response = 'nan', target = 'stjoseph’sconventschool'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_3: response = 'nan', target = 'santabarbaracitycollege'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_4: response = 'nan', target = 'st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_5: response = 'nan', target = 'blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_6: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  The target is also 'nan' (no target), response is 'nan' (no response). Since nothing to match, arguably correct (no answer expected). It's reasonable to give score = 1 here.

- idx_7: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  Same as idx_6 → score = 1

- idx_8: response = 'nan', target = 'universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_9: response = 'nan', target = 'universityofcincinnati(music)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_10: response = 'nan', target = 'universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_11: response = 'nan', target = 'prairieviewa&muniversity\n(chemicalengineering)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_12: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  target = 'nan' and response = 'nan' → score = 1

,,2016,2016,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the grading criteria:

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

**idx_14:**  
- Response: ""veterinarian""  
- Target: ""veterinarian; founder project street vet""  
Exact match.

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

**idx_14:**  
- Response: ""veterinarian""  
- Target: ""veterinarian; founder project street vet""

**idx_8**  
Response: gives young people with disabilities a brighter future  
Target: free therapy, education & mobility aids for disabled children

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""

""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.

**idx_2:**

**idx_7:**

- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.

""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'georgewashingtonuniversity'  
  No response given. No match → score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'cavitestateuniversity'

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'georgewashingtonuniversity'  
  No response given. No match → score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'cavitestateuniversity'  
  No response given → score = 0

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

  No response given. No match → score = 0

The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity. Background/occupation expressions can be approximate.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""co-founder, st.bernardproject (disaster recovery nonprofit project)""  
Evaluation: ""founder"" vs ""co-founder"" - co-founder is a specific kind of founder, so acceptable. The project name does not have to be matched since it’s about occupation/role.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""filipinoteacherandsocialdevelopmentworker""  
Very different in meaning: teacher/social development worker vs. founder. The response does not capture the occupation clearly.  
No indication of founder or similar role.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""activist""  
- Target: ""anti-trafficking social activist; founder maiti nepal...""  
""activist"" matches ""social activist""; the founder part is omitted but not required if main occupation is captured.  
Semantics are similar.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""midwife""  
- Target: ""midwife; founder bumisehat clinics""  
Exact match on occupation (midwife). Perfect.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""socialworker; founderecdc/butterflyhome""  
Exact match on occupation ""socialworker"". Good.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""environmental activist; founder living lands & waters""  
""founder"" matches ""founder"" exactly even though environmental activist is omitted; sufficient according to criteria.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""former royal marine; founder nowzad dogs""  
Response only states founder, target says ""founder"" + ""former royal marine"". Founder matches.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_7:**  
- Response: ""founder""  
- Target: ""philanthropist; co-founder blinknow""  
""founder"" ~ ""co-founder"" - acceptable. Philanthropist omitted, but per criteria, approximate is fine.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""disability-rights advocate; founder asodi valle""  
""socialworker"" vs ""disability-rights advocate"" are not exact but related social roles. However, ""socialworker"" does not capture ""disability-rights advocate"" quite well as these are distinct roles. Also ""founder"" is missing.  
This is borderline. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity are sufficient. Disability-rights advocate and socialworker could be seen as overlapping social roles. Hence acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_9:**  
- Response: ""businessowner""  
- Target: ""social entrepreneur; founder bitty & beau’s coffee""  
""businessowner"" ~ ""social entrepreneur"" - similar entity, both entrepreneurial roles.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_10:**  
- Response: ""doctor""  
- Target: ""physician; founder albergue inspira""  
""doctor"" = ""physician"" (equivalent), so acceptable.  
=> Score: 1

---

**idx_11:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""chemical engineer & inventor""  
Not similar. Socialworker is different from chemical engineer/inventor.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
- Target: ""the founder of the non-profit beauty2thestreetz""  
""socialworker"" vs ""founder"" of a nonprofit – not the same role or occupation. Founder is more relevant here than socialworker. No direct equivalence or approximate relationship.  
=> Score: 0

---

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""educator""  
- Target: ""tech entrepreneur; founder tech lit africa""  
""educator"" vs ""tech entrepreneur"" — different occupations, neither is the same as the other, although tech lit may imply education. But ""tech entrepreneur"" is about business/startup not necessarily educator.  
Since approximate semantics are allowed, this is borderline. The target’s emphasis is on entrepreneurship, response on education. This might be considered different unless the educational role is explicit. The criterion emphasizes approximate semantics or same entity. ""Educator"" and ""tech entrepreneur"" are distinct.  
Likely 0.  
=> Score: 0

```",freeveterinarycareforpetsofpeopleexperiencinghomelessness,caresforpetsofthoseexperiencinghomelessness,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item step by step:

**Criterion:**  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""  
""It is sufficient as long as the answer to be evaluated refers to the same university in the reference answer.""

Here, 'response' is 'nan' for every idx—meaning there is no answer provided, while the 'target' shows the expected university name.

Item-by-item:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'georgewashingtonuniversity'  
  No response given. No match → score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'cavitestateuniversity'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_2: response = 'nan', target = 'stjoseph’sconventschool'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_3: response = 'nan', target = 'santabarbaracitycollege'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_4: response = 'nan', target = 'st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_5: response = 'nan', target = 'blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_6: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  The target is also 'nan' (no target), response is 'nan' (no response). Since nothing to match, arguably correct (no answer expected). It's reasonable to give score = 1 here.

- idx_7: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  Same as idx_6 → score = 1

- idx_8: response = 'nan', target = 'universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_9: response = 'nan', target = 'universityofcincinnati(music)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_10: response = 'nan', target = 'universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_11: response = 'nan', target = 'prairieviewa&muniversity\n(chemicalengineering)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_12: response = 'nan', target = 'nan'  
  target = 'nan' and response = 'nan' → score = 1

- idx_13: response = 'nan', target = 'augustanacollege(cs&appliedmath)'  
  No response given → score = 0

- idx_14: response = 'nan', target = 'coloradostateuniversity(dvm)'
