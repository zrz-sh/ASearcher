fpawomen'shealth-fresno,FPA Women's Health,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"exact match, response: fresno, target: fresno",fresno,fresno,1.0,"Let's analyze the given pair step by step:

Pair idx_0:  
- Standard answer: ""165northclarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""  
- Response: ""165n.clarkstreet""  

Analysis according to the criterion:  
- The criterion states that semantics should be approximately the same or pointing to the same entity; exact match is not required.  
- The response gives ""165n.clarkstreet"" which is clearly the same address but abbreviated: ""n."" for ""north"", and no city or zip code.  
- Although the response omits ""fresno, ca93701"", it still points clearly to the same address because:  
  - ""165n.clarkstreet"" points to the same location as ""165northclarkstreet"".  
- The criterion does not require the full address with city and zip, just approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
- The abbreviations ""n."" vs ""north"" and the missing city/zip do not prevent the response from meaning the same entity.  

Conclusion: The response is good enough and meets the criterion, so it should be scored 1.

**Item idx_0**

- **Standard answer:** ""closed""
- **Response:** ""closed""
- **Criterion:** Semantics need to be approximately the same, or point to the same entity. Word-for-word correspondence is not necessary, but here it is exactly the same.

**Analysis:**  
The response matches the standard answer exactly, both are the word ""closed"". This clearly satisfies the criterion for full correctness.

**Score:** 1
