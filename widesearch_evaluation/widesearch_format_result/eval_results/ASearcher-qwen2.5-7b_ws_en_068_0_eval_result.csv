**idx_7:**  
Response: randomhouse  
Target: randomhouse(us)johnmurray(uk)  
Analysis: Partial match - the response is one of the publishers mentioned in the target. Since ""randomhouse"" corresponds exactly to one of the entities in the target string, it can be considered pointing to the same entity (partially). According to the criterion, approximate semantics or entity match is sufficient.

- The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

Step-by-step:

1. idx_0: response = 'jenniferegan', target = 'jenniferegan'  
   - Exact match → Score: 1

2. idx_1: response = 'claire-louisebennett', target = 'claire-louisebennett'  
   - Exact match → Score: 1

3. idx_2: response = 'barbarakingsolver', target = 'barbarakingsolver'  
   - Exact match → Score: 1

4. idx_3: response = 'paulmurray', target = 'paulmurray'  
   - Exact match → Score: 1

5. idx_4: response = 'nanakwameadjei-brenyah', target = 'nanakwameadjei-brenyah'  
   - Exact match → Score: 1

6. idx_5: response = 'maylisdekerangal', target = 'maylisdekerangal'  
   - Exact match → Score: 1

7. idx_6: response = 'matthewthomas', target = 'zadiesmith'  
   - Different entities → Score: 0

8. idx_7: response = 'rachelkushner', target = 'danielmason'  
   - Different entities → Score: 0

No approximations or near matches for idx_6 and idx_7, so both get 0.
