### Analysis:

- **idx_0:**
  - Response: ""olympic""
  - Target (standard answer): ""olympics""
  - The criterion states that semantics being approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
  - ""Olympic"" and ""Olympics"" here clearly refer to the same entity — the Olympic Games.
  - Therefore, this should be scored 1.

- **idx_1:**
  - Same as idx_0.
  - Response: ""olympic""
  - Target: ""olympics""
  - Same reasoning applies.
  - Score should be 1.

- **idx_2:**
  - Same as idx_0.
  - Response: ""olympic""
  - Target: ""olympics""
  - Same reasoning applies.
  - Score should be 1.

### Final scoring result:

```",olympics,olympic,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion:  
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

- Response: ""gold""

Analysis: ""gold"" is commonly used as shorthand for ""gold medal."" They point to the same entity, so it is considered correct.

- Response: ""gold""  
- Target: ""goldmedal""  
Analysis: Same as idx_0; considered correct.

**idx_2**

Criterion summary: 
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- No need for exact word-for-word correspondence.

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""eileengu,tessledeux,eileengu""
- Target: ""gueileen\nledeuxtess\ngremaudmathilde""

Compare each entity:

- ""eileengu"" vs ""gueileen"": likely a misspelling or jumbled version, but clearly referring to the same entity ""Gueileen""
- ""tessledeux"" vs ""ledeuxtess"": again, appears to be the same entity in different ordering (Tess Ledeux)
- ""eileengu"" vs ""gremaudmathilde"": different entities here: The response repeats ""eileengu"" twice, while the target gives a third different name.

Since two out of three responses approximately match corresponding entities, and the third is off, but the criterion states ""semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" per whole answer, it depends if the answer requires full matching or partial is enough.

Given the question probably expects full list and response only gives two entities correct and repeats one again instead of providing the third, this seems incomplete.

But the criterion is quite lenient. However, the criterion does not explicitly say partial matching is enough. Since the third name is replaced wrongly, I'd consider this incorrect overall.

Therefore: Score = 0

---

### idx_1
- Response: ""eileengu,hannahteter,chloekim""
- Target: ""gueileen\ncassiesharpe\nrachaelkarker""

Compare each entity:

- ""eileengu"" vs ""gueileen"": matches same person (Gueileen)
- ""hannahteter"" vs ""cassiesharpe"": different names, different people
- ""chloekim"" vs ""rachaelkarker"": different names/entities

Only the first matches. The other two are not the same or semantically linked. Therefore the response does not approximate the target well.

Score = 0

---

### idx_2
- Response: ""eileengu,tessledeux,juliamarino""
- Target: ""gremaudmathilde\ngueileen\nsildarukelly""

Compare each entity:

- ""eileengu"" vs ""gueileen"": matches
- ""tessledeux"" vs ""gremaudmathilde"": different entities
- ""juliamarino"" vs ""sildarukelly"": different entities

Only one match out of three. Not sufficient.

Score = 0

None of the responses fully or approximately match all three target entities.
