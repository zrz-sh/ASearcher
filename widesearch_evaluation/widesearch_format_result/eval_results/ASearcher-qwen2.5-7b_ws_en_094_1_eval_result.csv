Criterion summary: The semantics need to be approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity. Word-for-word matching is not required.

---

**idx_0 to idx_11:**

- Response: ""action""  
- Target: ""action""  
Exact match; clearly points to the same entity, so score = 1.

---

**idx_12:**

- Response: ""romance""

Different genres; ""romance"" and ""action"" are distinct semantic categories so do not point to the same entity. Score = 0.

---

**idx_13:**

- Response: ""action""  
- Target: ""historicalaction""  

""historicalaction"" can be interpreted as a subgenre or compound genre involving action elements plus historical. Response ""action"" covers a broader or parent category (action) that includes ""historicalaction"" as a subcategory.  
Since the response (""action"") is a broader category that semantically includes ""historical action,"" this can be considered approximately the same or refer to the same entity on the genre level. Score = 1.

**idx_0 to idx_11:**

- Response: ""action""  
- Target: ""action""  
Exact match; clearly points to the same entity, so score = 1.

""historicalaction"" can be interpreted as a subgenre or compound genre involving action elements plus historical. Response ""action"" covers a broader or parent category (action) that includes ""historicalaction"" as a subcategory.

---

**idx_0 to idx_11:**

- Response: ""action""  
- Target: ""action""  
Exact match; clearly points to the same entity, so score = 1.

---

Different genres; ""romance"" and ""action"" are distinct semantic categories so do not point to the same entity. Score = 0.

""historicalaction"" can be interpreted as a subgenre or compound genre involving action elements plus historical. Response ""action"" covers a broader or parent category (action) that includes ""historicalaction"" as a subcategory.  
Since the response (""action"") is a broader category that semantically includes ""historical action,"" this can be considered approximately the same or refer to the same entity on the genre level. Score = 1.
