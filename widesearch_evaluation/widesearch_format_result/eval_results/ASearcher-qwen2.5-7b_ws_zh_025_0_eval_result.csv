Criterion summary:
- Semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- Exact wording is not required.
- No additional negative items or deductions are mentioned.
- Xiaomi Hyper OS = Xiaomi Hyper also acceptable.

Given responses vs targets:

1. idx_0: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - MIUI 12 is a Xiaomi customized OS skin based on Android.
   - Response ""android"" is more general, not exactly MIUI12.
   - Criterion allows semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity.
   - ""android"" is an OS, but ""miui12"" is a specific version of a skin on Android.
   - The response is less precise and does not refer to the exact OS version or skin.
   - Is ""android"" semantically the same as ""miui12""? No, miui12 is a customized version layered on Android, so the answer is less specific.
   - The criterion says ""semantic approximate or referring to the same entity"".
   - Android != MIUI12; MIUI12 is based on Android but not the same.
   - So it is not the same entity.
   - According to instructions, the score should be 0 or 1 only.
   - Given this, ""android"" is just the base OS, not the target.
   - So, score: 0.

2. idx_1: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same reasoning as idx_0.
   - ""android"" is not equivalent to ""miui14"".
   - Score: 0.

3. idx_2: response ""android"", target ""miui10""
   - Same as above.
   - Score: 0.

4. idx_3: response ""android"", target ""miui11""
   - Same reasoning.
   - Score: 0.

5. idx_4: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - Same as idx_0.
   - Score: 0.

6. idx_5: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same as idx_1.
   - Score: 0.

7. idx_6: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""
   - Target is Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 (also acceptable if written Xiaomi Hyper).
   - The response is simply ""android"".
   - Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 is based on Android but is a specifically named OS.
   - Response ""android"" is general, does not specifically point to Xiaomi Hyper OS.
   - The criterion says approximate semantic or pointing to the same entity.
   - Android is the base but not the exact same entity as Xiaomi Hyper OS 2.
   - So, the response is insufficient.
   - Score: 0.

8. idx_7: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""
   - Same as idx_6.

Criterion summary:
- Semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- Exact wording is not required.
- No additional negative items or deductions are mentioned.
- Xiaomi Hyper OS = Xiaomi Hyper also acceptable.

Given responses vs targets:

1. idx_0: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - MIUI 12 is a Xiaomi customized OS skin based on Android.
   - Response ""android"" is more general, not exactly MIUI12.
   - Criterion allows semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity.
   - ""android"" is an OS, but ""miui12"" is a specific version of a skin on Android.
   - The response is less precise and does not refer to the exact OS version or skin.
   - Is ""android"" semantically the same as ""miui12""? No, miui12 is a customized version layered on Android, so the answer is less specific.
   - The criterion says ""semantic approximate or referring to the same entity"".
   - Android != MIUI12; MIUI12 is based on Android but not the same.
   - So it is not the same entity.
   - According to instructions, the score should be 0 or 1 only.
   - Given this, ""android"" is just the base OS, not the target.
   - So, score: 0.

2. idx_1: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same reasoning as idx_0.
   - ""android"" is not equivalent to ""miui14"".
   - Score: 0.

3. idx_2: response ""android"", target ""miui10""
   - Same as above.
   - Score: 0.

4. idx_3: response ""android"", target ""miui11""
   - Same reasoning.
   - Score: 0.

5. idx_4: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - Same as idx_0.
   - Score: 0.

6. idx_5: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same as idx_1.
   - Score: 0.

7. idx_6: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""
   - Target is Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 (also acceptable if written Xiaomi Hyper).
   - The response is simply ""android"".
   - Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 is based on Android but is a specifically named OS.
   - Response ""android"" is general, does not specifically point to Xiaomi Hyper OS.
   - The criterion says approximate semantic or pointing to the same entity.
   - Android is the base but not the exact same entity as Xiaomi Hyper OS 2.
   - So, the response is insufficient.
   - Score: 0.

8. idx_7: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""
   - Same as idx_6.

**idx_2:**

- Resolution is width x height, and commonly, the first number is width and second is height.  
- 1080x2340 != 2340x1080, so these indicate different resolutions (one is 1080 pixels wide and 2340 pixels tall, the other is the reverse).

Criterion summary:
- Semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- Exact wording is not required.
- No additional negative items or deductions are mentioned.
- Xiaomi Hyper OS = Xiaomi Hyper also acceptable.

Given responses vs targets:

1. idx_0: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - MIUI 12 is a Xiaomi customized OS skin based on Android.
   - Response ""android"" is more general, not exactly MIUI12.
   - Criterion allows semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity.
   - ""android"" is an OS, but ""miui12"" is a specific version of a skin on Android.
   - The response is less precise and does not refer to the exact OS version or skin.
   - Is ""android"" semantically the same as ""miui12""? No, miui12 is a customized version layered on Android, so the answer is less specific.
   - The criterion says ""semantic approximate or referring to the same entity"".
   - Android != MIUI12; MIUI12 is based on Android but not the same.
   - So it is not the same entity.
   - According to instructions, the score should be 0 or 1 only.
   - Given this, ""android"" is just the base OS, not the target.
   - So, score: 0.

2. idx_1: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same reasoning as idx_0.
   - ""android"" is not equivalent to ""miui14"".
   - Score: 0.

3. idx_2: response ""android"", target ""miui10""
   - Same as above.
   - Score: 0.

4. idx_3: response ""android"", target ""miui11""
   - Same reasoning.
   - Score: 0.

5. idx_4: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - Same as idx_0.
   - Score: 0.

6. idx_5: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same as idx_1.
   - Score: 0.

7. idx_6: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""
   - Target is Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 (also acceptable if written Xiaomi Hyper).
   - The response is simply ""android"".
   - Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 is based on Android but is a specifically named OS.
   - Response ""android"" is general, does not specifically point to Xiaomi Hyper OS.
   - The criterion says approximate semantic or pointing to the same entity.
   - Android is the base but not the exact same entity as Xiaomi Hyper OS 2.
   - So, the response is insufficient.
   - Score: 0.

8. idx_7: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""
   - Same as idx_6.

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""1080x2340像素""

- Numbers are the same but reversed order.  
- Resolution is width x height, and commonly, the first number is width and second is height.  
- 1080x2340 != 2340x1080, so these indicate different resolutions (one is 1080 pixels wide and 2340 pixels tall, the other is the reverse).

Criterion summary:
- Semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- Exact wording is not required.
- No additional negative items or deductions are mentioned.
- Xiaomi Hyper OS = Xiaomi Hyper also acceptable.

Given responses vs targets:

1. idx_0: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - MIUI 12 is a Xiaomi customized OS skin based on Android.
   - Response ""android"" is more general, not exactly MIUI12.
   - Criterion allows semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity.
   - ""android"" is an OS, but ""miui12"" is a specific version of a skin on Android.
   - The response is less precise and does not refer to the exact OS version or skin.
   - Is ""android"" semantically the same as ""miui12""? No, miui12 is a customized version layered on Android, so the answer is less specific.
   - The criterion says ""semantic approximate or referring to the same entity"".
   - Android != MIUI12; MIUI12 is based on Android but not the same.
   - So it is not the same entity.
   - According to instructions, the score should be 0 or 1 only.
   - Given this, ""android"" is just the base OS, not the target.
   - So, score: 0.

2. idx_1: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same reasoning as idx_0.
   - ""android"" is not equivalent to ""miui14"".
   - Score: 0.

3. idx_2: response ""android"", target ""miui10""
   - Same as above.
   - Score: 0.

4. idx_3: response ""android"", target ""miui11""
   - Same reasoning.
   - Score: 0.

5. idx_4: response ""android"", target ""miui12""
   - Same as idx_0.
   - Score: 0.

6. idx_5: response ""android"", target ""miui14""
   - Same as idx_1.
   - Score: 0.

7. idx_6: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""
   - Target is Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 (also acceptable if written Xiaomi Hyper).
   - The response is simply ""android"".
   - Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 is based on Android but is a specifically named OS.
   - Response ""android"" is general, does not specifically point to Xiaomi Hyper OS.
   - The criterion says approximate semantic or pointing to the same entity.
   - Android is the base but not the exact same entity as Xiaomi Hyper OS 2.
   - So, the response is insufficient.
   - Score: 0.

8. idx_7: response ""android"", target ""xiaomihyperos2""

**idx_2:**

- Resolution is width x height, and commonly, the first number is width and second is height.  
- 1080x2340 != 2340x1080, so these indicate different resolutions (one is 1080 pixels wide and 2340 pixels tall, the other is the reverse).
