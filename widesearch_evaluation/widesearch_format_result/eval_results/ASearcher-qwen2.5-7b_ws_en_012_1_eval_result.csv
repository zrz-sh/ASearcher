The target is the country, response is a city within the country. Criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
Los Angeles is a city within the United States, so the response is a more specific entity within the target entity. This can be considered pointing to the same entity group.

**idx_0**  
Response: rebuilding homes in disaster-stricken U.S. communities  
Target: post-katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents

**idx_0**  
Response: rebuilding homes in disaster-stricken U.S. communities  
Target: post-katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents

The target is the country, response is a city within the country. Criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
Los Angeles is a city within the United States, so the response is a more specific entity within the target entity. This can be considered pointing to the same entity group.  
Hence, accept → Score: 1

**idx_0**  
Response: rebuilding homes in disaster-stricken U.S. communities  
Target: post-katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents

**idx_12**  
Response: ""losangeles""  
Target: ""unitedstates""  
The target is the country, response is a city within the country. Criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
Los Angeles is a city within the United States, so the response is a more specific entity within the target entity. This can be considered pointing to the same entity group.  
Hence, accept → Score: 1

**idx_13**  
Response: ""kenya""

**idx_0**  
Response: rebuilding homes in disaster-stricken U.S. communities  
Target: post-katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents  
Analysis: Both focus on home rebuilding in disaster-stricken US areas. Katrina is a specific disaster, but general disaster-stricken communities imply the same domain. The semantics are similar (home rebuilding in disaster-affected areas).  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: saving lives during hurricane gustav in Louisiana  
Target: “pushcart classroom” mobile schooling for street children

Score: 0

---

**idx_2**

Score: 0

---

**idx_5**

Analysis: The target named ""Kopila Valley children’s home..."" is an entity providing education/care for children and women in Nepal. Response mentions education and care for orphaned and vulnerable children in Nepal. This is a close semantic match (same entity domain and location), presumably the response's paraphrase matches the target.  
Score: 1

---

Response: caring for homeless pets and their owners in Los Angeles  
Target: free therapy, education & mobility aids for disabled children  
Analysis: Completely different topics (homeless pets vs disabled children).

Response: bringing beauty and hope to the homeless in Skid Row, Los Angeles  
Target: beauty, hygiene, food & advocacy for unhoused people  
Analysis: Response includes ""beauty and hope"" for homeless people in Skid Row (a famous homeless area of LA). Target includes beauty, hygiene, food, and advocacy for unhoused people. The core focus on beauty and help for unhoused matches, though target mentions additional services. Still semantically close, as beauty/hygiene/food/advocacy are overlapping themes with ""bringing beauty and hope""  
Score: 1

---

Response: using technology to improve digital literacy and access to information in Kenya  
Target: builds computer labs & teaches digital skills in rural schools

Target: temporary foster care for pets while owners enter addiction treatment

**Criteria Recap:**  
- If the response points to the same university as the target, the score = 1.  
- It is sufficient to have approximate semantic similarity or reference to the same university.  
- Supplementary details like majors do not matter.  
- Answer 0 means incorrect or missing (or ""nan"" in this case).
