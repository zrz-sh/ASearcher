- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).

- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.

- idx_0: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1
- idx_1: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1
- idx_2: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1

- idx_4: ""zen+"" same as above, score = 1
- idx_5: ""zen+"" same as above, score = 1

- idx_6: ""zen2"" indicates a specific generation, could arguably still be considered ""zen family"", but it differs from just ""zen"". The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity. Since ""zen2"" is a different generation but from same family, it points to same entity type broadly. Score = 1

- idx_8: ""zen2"" same, score = 1
- idx_9: ""zen2"" same, score = 1

- idx_10: ""zen3+"" indicates a later generation than ""zen"". The base entity is ""zen"", and the variants/extensions fall under same category. According to criterion, approximate semantics is fine. score = 1

- idx_12: ""zen3"" same, score = 1
- idx_13: ""zen3"" same, score = 1

All responses share the same semantic root or clearly point to the ""zen"" entity, so according to the criterion, all responses merit a score of 1.

- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).

- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- idx_1: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1
- idx_2: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1

- idx_5: ""zen+"" same as above, score = 1

- idx_6: ""zen2"" indicates a specific generation, could arguably still be considered ""zen family"", but it differs from just ""zen"". The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).

- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.

```",tsmc7nmfinfet,7,1.0,"exact match, response: nan, target: nan",nan,nan,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item:

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).

- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.

- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.

The target for all is ""zen"".

- idx_0: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1
- idx_1: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1
- idx_2: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""zen+"" → ""zen+"" is a variant or enhancement of ""zen"", but it still points to same entity family. According to criterion, same or approximate semantics is enough, score = 1
- idx_4: ""zen+"" same as above, score = 1
- idx_5: ""zen+"" same as above, score = 1

- idx_6: ""zen2"" indicates a specific generation, could arguably still be considered ""zen family"", but it differs from just ""zen"". The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity. Since ""zen2"" is a different generation but from same family, it points to same entity type broadly. Score = 1
- idx_7: ""zen2"" same, score = 1
- idx_8: ""zen2"" same, score = 1
- idx_9: ""zen2"" same, score = 1

- idx_10: ""zen3+"" indicates a later generation than ""zen"". The base entity is ""zen"", and the variants/extensions fall under same category. According to criterion, approximate semantics is fine. score = 1
- idx_11: ""zen3"" same reasoning, score = 1
- idx_12: ""zen3"" same, score = 1
- idx_13: ""zen3"" same, score = 1
- idx_14: ""zen3"" same, score = 1

All responses share the same semantic root or clearly point to the ""zen"" entity, so according to the criterion, all responses merit a score of 1.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- idx_6: ""zen2"" indicates a specific generation, could arguably still be considered ""zen family"", but it differs from just ""zen"". The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity.

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.

The target for all is ""zen"".

- idx_0: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1
- idx_1: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1
- idx_2: response = ""zen"" → Exact match, score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""zen+"" → ""zen+"" is a variant or enhancement of ""zen"", but it still points to same entity family. According to criterion, same or approximate semantics is enough, score = 1
- idx_4: ""zen+"" same as above, score = 1
- idx_5: ""zen+"" same as above, score = 1

- idx_6: ""zen2"" indicates a specific generation, could arguably still be considered ""zen family"", but it differs from just ""zen"". The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity. Since ""zen2"" is a different generation but from same family, it points to same entity type broadly. Score = 1
- idx_7: ""zen2"" same, score = 1
- idx_8: ""zen2"" same, score = 1
- idx_9: ""zen2"" same, score = 1

- idx_10: ""zen3+"" indicates a later generation than ""zen"". The base entity is ""zen"", and the variants/extensions fall under same category. According to criterion, approximate semantics is fine. score = 1
- idx_11: ""zen3"" same reasoning, score = 1
- idx_12: ""zen3"" same, score = 1
- idx_13: ""zen3"" same, score = 1
- idx_14: ""zen3"" same, score = 1

- idx_15: ""zen4"" same reasoning as above, a later gen of ""zen"", score = 1

All responses share the same semantic root or clearly point to the ""zen"" entity, so according to the criterion, all responses merit a score of 1.

- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.

- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.

- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

```",tsmc5nmfinfet,5,1.0,"exact match, response: nan, target: nan",nan,nan,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item:

- The target answers specify specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzen2000series, ryzen3000series, ryzen5000series, ryzen7000series).
- The responses all say ""ryzen™"".
- The grading criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- ""ryzen™"" refers to the Ryzen brand, which includes all these series.
- However, the targets are asking for a specific series, while the response only gives the generic brand.
- Does ""ryzen™"" sufficiently specify the same semantics as ""ryzen1000series"" or other specific series?
- While ""ryzen™"" points to the entity Ryzen in general, the target explicitly points to specific series.
- The grading criterion says it is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- But here the target is a specific series, not just the general brand.
- The concept of ""same entity"" here could be interpreted as the brand (Ryzen) vs. the product line within the brand (Ryzen 1000 series, etc.). These are not exactly the same entity because the target is more specific.
- Because the responses do not specify the series as requested, they are less accurate.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient or pointing to the same entity. Since ""ryzen1000series"" is a different entity than ""ryzen™"" (the whole brand), this is a mismatch.
- Therefore, each response should be scored 0.

Final grading result:
All scores are 0.
