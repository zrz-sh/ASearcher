### idx_0

- Response: ""约100-51200""

- Analysis:  
  - The response range is ""100 to 51200"".

- 这里响应的起点1/4000秒和标准答案的1/8000秒不相同，但1/4000秒比1/8000秒慢，是起点范围的放宽，理论上属实依情况合理的范围调整，不构成错误。

**idx_0**  
Response: ""expeed6""  
Target: ""双expeed6"" (double expeed6)  
Analysis:  
The response omits the ""双"" (double/dual) modifier. This potentially changes the meaning because ""双expeed6"" implies two Expeed6 units, while ""expeed6"" is just one. According to the criterion, the meaning needs to be generally the same or the entity referred to consistent. Here, ""双expeed6"" and ""expeed6"" are not semantically the same; ""双expeed6"" means a dual system vs single; hence entities differ. Therefore, this should be scored 0.

9 and 10 are very close numbers, the meaning is roughly the same (frame rate around 9-10 fps). Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, this should be accepted as correct.

Since the difference is about 4 fps (about 28%), this might exceed the ""roughly the same"" boundary. Therefore, to be cautious, I would score 0 here because the numbers differ more significantly.

The criterion states that if the response and the target answer have roughly the same meaning or point to the same entity, it's considered correct (score 1). Exact wording or number match is not necessary; approximate equivalence is acceptable.

Here, the targets are approximate weights:

- idx_3: target ""约675g"", response ""约605g""  
Difference: 70g, approx 10.37% difference, which is larger than previous cases. This may be borderline.

### idx_0

- Response: ""约100-51200""

  - The response range is ""100 to 51200"".

**idx_0**  
Response: ""expeed6""

Analysis:  
The response omits the ""双"" (double/dual) modifier. This potentially changes the meaning because ""双expeed6"" implies two Expeed6 units, while ""expeed6"" is just one. According to the criterion, the meaning needs to be generally the same or the entity referred to consistent. Here, ""双expeed6"" and ""expeed6"" are not semantically the same; ""双expeed6"" means a dual system vs single; hence entities differ. Therefore, this should be scored 0.

9 and 10 are very close numbers, the meaning is roughly the same (frame rate around 9-10 fps). Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, this should be accepted as correct.

10 vs 14: difference is a bit larger but still possibly close depending on context. However, 10 fps and 14 fps might not be considered the same ""approximately"" here, especially given the difference between 9 and 10 is accepted as close.  
Since the difference is about 4 fps (about 28%), this might exceed the ""roughly the same"" boundary. Therefore, to be cautious, I would score 0 here because the numbers differ more significantly.

The criterion states that if the response and the target answer have roughly the same meaning or point to the same entity, it's considered correct (score 1). Exact wording or number match is not necessary; approximate equivalence is acceptable.

Here, the targets are approximate weights:

- idx_0: target ""约705g"", response ""约735g""  
Difference: 30g, approx 4.25% difference from target. Given the instruction ""大致相同"" (roughly the same), this seems close enough to be considered equivalent. --> score 1

- idx_1: target ""约675g"", response ""约715g""  
Difference: 40g, approx 5.9% difference from target. Slightly more, but still close and ""约"" (about) implies some tolerance. Considered roughly equal. --> score 1

- idx_2: target ""约705g"", response ""约705g""  
Exact match. --> score 1

- idx_3: target ""约675g"", response ""约605g""  
Difference: 70g, approx 10.37% difference, which is larger than previous cases. This may be borderline. But since ""和参考答案语义相同大致即可"", a difference is acceptable if it refers to the same entity (approximate weight). The difference of 70g (~10%) might be too large to still say ""roughly the same"". Given the context, this is likely not sufficiently close. --> score 0

- 标准答案中快门速度范围的起点是1/8000秒，部分说明了可微调步长，M模式下可扩展至900秒。
- 响应答案中快门速度范围起点是1/4000秒，终点一致都是30秒。
- 评分标准中提到，范围的最高或最低值可根据实际进行调整，并且无需字字对应，只要语义大致或指向实体一致即可。
- 这里响应的起点1/4000秒和标准答案的1/8000秒不相同，但1/4000秒比1/8000秒慢，是起点范围的放宽，理论上属实依情况合理的范围调整，不构成错误。
- 终点30秒保持一致，括号内容省略不影响整体范围理解，仍属对。
- 因此响应与标准答案语义大致相符，可以给全分1分。

针对五个idx，都是同样的响应和相似标准答案情况，全都应给1分。

**idx_0**  
Response: ""expeed6""  
Target: ""双expeed6"" (double expeed6)  
Analysis:  
The response omits the ""双"" (double/dual) modifier. This potentially changes the meaning because ""双expeed6"" implies two Expeed6 units, while ""expeed6"" is just one. According to the criterion, the meaning needs to be generally the same or the entity referred to consistent. Here, ""双expeed6"" and ""expeed6"" are not semantically the same; ""双expeed6"" means a dual system vs single; hence entities differ. Therefore, this should be scored 0.

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""expeed6""  
Target: ""expeed6""  
Analysis:  
Identical entity; obviously semantically consistent. Score: 1.

---

**idx_2**  
Response: ""expeed6""  
Target: ""双expeed6""  
Same as idx_0, response lacks ""双"" modifier, so meaning shifts from dual to single, not consistent. Score: 0.

Response: ""expeed6""  
Target: ""expeed6""

### idx_0:  
- Response: 约9幅/秒  
- Target: 约10幅/秒  
Analysis:  
9 and 10 are very close numbers, the meaning is roughly the same (frame rate around 9-10 fps). Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, this should be accepted as correct.  
Score: 1

### idx_1:  
- Response: 约10幅/秒  
- Target: 约9幅/秒  
Analysis:  
Same as idx_0 but reversed. Close numbers (around 9 or 10 fps). Approximately the same semantic meaning.  
Score: 1

### idx_2:  
- Response: 约10幅/秒  
- Target: 约14幅/秒  
Analysis:  
10 vs 14: difference is a bit larger but still possibly close depending on context. However, 10 fps and 14 fps might not be considered the same ""approximately"" here, especially given the difference between 9 and 10 is accepted as close.  
Since the difference is about 4 fps (about 28%), this might exceed the ""roughly the same"" boundary. Therefore, to be cautious, I would score 0 here because the numbers differ more significantly.  
Score: 0

### idx_3:  
- Response: 约12幅/秒  
- Target: 约12幅/秒  
Analysis:  
Exactly the same.  
Score: 1

### idx_4:  
- Response: 约14幅/秒  
- Target: 约4.5幅/秒  
Analysis:  
14 vs 4.5 is a very large difference (approx 3 times). Not roughly the same, semantically not close.  
Score: 0

**Grading criteria:**
- The response and the target should have the same or approximate semantic meaning.
- The response does not have to match word by word.
- Matching the referred entity is sufficient.

**Analysis of each idx:**

1. **idx_0**  
   - Response: ""vrii""

**Summary: all responses are ""vrii"" which does not match or relate semantically to any of the target answers.**

    ""idx_0"": 0,

```",影像传感器5轴移动,vrii,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Analysis:

The criterion states that if the response and the target answer have roughly the same meaning or point to the same entity, it's considered correct (score 1). Exact wording or number match is not necessary; approximate equivalence is acceptable.

Here, the targets are approximate weights:

- idx_0: target ""约705g"", response ""约735g""  
Difference: 30g, approx 4.25% difference from target. Given the instruction ""大致相同"" (roughly the same), this seems close enough to be considered equivalent. --> score 1

- idx_1: target ""约675g"", response ""约715g""  
Difference: 40g, approx 5.9% difference from target. Slightly more, but still close and ""约"" (about) implies some tolerance. Considered roughly equal. --> score 1

- idx_2: target ""约705g"", response ""约705g""  
Exact match. --> score 1

- idx_3: target ""约675g"", response ""约605g""  
Difference: 70g, approx 10.37% difference, which is larger than previous cases. This may be borderline. But since ""和参考答案语义相同大致即可"", a difference is acceptable if it refers to the same entity (approximate weight). The difference of 70g (~10%) might be too large to still say ""roughly the same"". Given the context, this is likely not sufficiently close. --> score 0

- idx_4: target ""约675g"", response ""约630g""  
Difference: 45g, approx 6.7% difference, somewhat close, probably still acceptable for approximate weight. --> score 1
