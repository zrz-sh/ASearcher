centralafricanrepublic,Central African Republic,,,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair item by item according to the criterion:

Criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

Check if the response is correct (points to the same entity as the target).
