- Response: ""1845waianaest,honolulu,hi96817""

Analysis: Same zip, and ""muirwoodsdrive"" vs ""muirwoodsrd"" is close but not exact — probably referring to the same general place? Marincounty includes Mill Valley, so the city differs but county is mentioned. The addresses are very similar in essence.

Given the approximate semantics and same entity context (Muir Woods area), this counts as correct.

Given that Springdale is the gateway and zip matches, this is acceptable as same entity approx.

Analysis: Same city but zip differs (95538 vs 95531). Different addresses, but fairly close zip codes and same city.

Due to zip code difference, let's consider if this counts as same entity approx.

Given both are Crescent City, CA, the different zip might represent nearby zones of same city. Criterion is ""approximately the same semantics or same entity"".

- Response: ""1845waianaest,honolulu,hi96817""
- Target: ""1arizonamemorialpl,honoluluhi96818""

Analysis: Both have the same city (Honolulu, HI) but different street addresses and zip codes differ (96817 vs 96818). They clearly point to different locations.

Score: 0

- Response: ""1muirwoodsdrive,marincounty,ca94941""

Analysis: Same zip, and ""muirwoodsdrive"" vs ""muirwoodsrd"" is close but not exact — probably referring to the same general place? Marincounty includes Mill Valley, so the city differs but county is mentioned. The addresses are very similar in essence.

Given the approximate semantics and same entity context (Muir Woods area), this counts as correct.

Given that Springdale is the gateway and zip matches, this is acceptable as same entity approx.

**idx_11**

- Target: ""1111secondstreet\ncrescentcity,ca95531""

Analysis: Same city but zip differs (95538 vs 95531). Different addresses, but fairly close zip codes and same city.

Due to zip code difference, let's consider if this counts as same entity approx.

Given both are Crescent City, CA, the different zip might represent nearby zones of same city. Criterion is ""approximately the same semantics or same entity"".

- Response: ""1845waianaest,honolulu,hi96817""

Analysis: Both have the same city (Honolulu, HI) but different street addresses and zip codes differ (96817 vs 96818). They clearly point to different locations.

Score: 0

**idx_1**

- Response: ""1muirwoodsdrive,marincounty,ca94941""
- Target: ""1muirwoodsrd,millvalleyca94941""

Analysis: Same zip, and ""muirwoodsdrive"" vs ""muirwoodsrd"" is close but not exact — probably referring to the same general place? Marincounty includes Mill Valley, so the city differs but county is mentioned. The addresses are very similar in essence.

Given the approximate semantics and same entity context (Muir Woods area), this counts as correct.

Analysis: Both in Springdale, UT, same zip, response is PO Box, target is national park street address in same town. Addresses point to Zion NP but differ.

Given that Springdale is the gateway and zip matches, this is acceptable as same entity approx.

**idx_11**

- Response: ""pobox8,crescentcity,ca95538""
- Target: ""1111secondstreet\ncrescentcity,ca95531""

Analysis: Same city but zip differs (95538 vs 95531). Different addresses, but fairly close zip codes and same city.

Due to zip code difference, let's consider if this counts as same entity approx.

Given both are Crescent City, CA, the different zip might represent nearby zones of same city. Criterion is ""approximately the same semantics or same entity"".

Likely count as matching because same city and close zip.

**idx_11**

- Response: ""pobox8,crescentcity,ca95538""
- Target: ""1111secondstreet\ncrescentcity,ca95531""

Analysis: Same city but zip differs (95538 vs 95531). Different addresses, but fairly close zip codes and same city.

Due to zip code difference, let's consider if this counts as same entity approx.

Given both are Crescent City, CA, the different zip might represent nearby zones of same city. Criterion is ""approximately the same semantics or same entity"".

Likely count as matching because same city and close zip.

**idx_10**

- Response: ""1000nparkave,gatlinburg,tn37738""

Analysis: Same city and zip; different street addresses but both within the park area (""Park Headquarters Rd"" vs ""N Park Ave""). Approximate same entity.

Score: 1

**idx_11**

- Response: ""pobox8,crescentcity,ca95538""
- Target: ""1111secondstreet\ncrescentcity,ca95531""

Analysis: Same city but zip differs (95538 vs 95531). Different addresses, but fairly close zip codes and same city.

Due to zip code difference, let's consider if this counts as same entity approx.

Given both are Crescent City, CA, the different zip might represent nearby zones of same city. Criterion is ""approximately the same semantics or same entity"".

Likely count as matching because same city and close zip.

**idx_10**

- Response: ""1000nparkave,gatlinburg,tn37738""
- Target: ""107parkheadquartersrd,gatlinburgtn37738""

Analysis: Same city and zip; different street addresses but both within the park area (""Park Headquarters Rd"" vs ""N Park Ave""). Approximate same entity.

Score: 1

---

**idx_11**

- Response: ""pobox8,crescentcity,ca95538""
- Target: ""1111secondstreet\ncrescentcity,ca95531""

Analysis: Same city but zip differs (95538 vs 95531). Different addresses, but fairly close zip codes and same city.

Due to zip code difference, let's consider if this counts as same entity approx.

Given both are Crescent City, CA, the different zip might represent nearby zones of same city. Criterion is ""approximately the same semantics or same entity"".

Likely count as matching because same city and close zip.

Score: 1

**idx_12**

- Response: ""pobox627,moab,ut84532""
- Target: ""2282resourceblvd,moabut84532""

Analysis: Both Moab, UT 84532; response is PO Box, target is street address. Same entity approx.

Score: 1

- idx_0: response = ""hawaii"", target = ""hawaiʻi""  
  ""hawaii"" is a standard English form of ""hawaiʻi"" (which uses the ʻokina). Semantics are the same entity. Score = 1

- idx_1: response = ""california"", target = ""california""  
  Exact match. Score = 1

- idx_2: response = ""southdakota"", target = ""southdakota""

- idx_5: response = ""utah"", target = ""utah""

- idx_6: response = ""wyoming/idaho/montana"", target = ""wyoming,montana,idaho""  
  All three states are included in the response, just separates with slashes rather than commas, and the order differs. Since scale is approximate semantics and same entities, order and delimiter do not matter. Score = 1

- idx_7: response = ""maine"", target = ""maine""  
  Exact match. Score = 1

- idx_8: response = ""oregon"", target = ""oregon""  
  Exact match. Score = 1

```",utah,utah,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx:

- Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

Given that all responses are `'-'` and targets are usernames such as 'tomleatherman', 'davidsmith', etc., none of the responses approximate or point to the target entities.

In other words, each response is a dash `'-'`, which semantically is not the same nor does it point to the target entity.

Therefore, for each idx, the score is 0.
