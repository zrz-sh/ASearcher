  Different URLs, different domains, ""bris"" vs ""bristol"". Although ""bris"" might be an abbreviation for Bristol, the criterion allows approximate semantics or links to the same entity.  
  - ""bris.ac.uk"" is not the official Bristol URL; ""bristol.ac.uk"" is official. ""bris.ac.uk"" does not resolve or is not the same as ""bristol.ac.uk"". So the response is not pointing to the exact entity.

- idx_0: Response: https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/  
  Target: https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/  
  Exact match → Score 1

- idx_1: Response: https://www.bris.ac.uk/  
  Target: https://bristol.ac.uk/  
  Different URLs, different domains, ""bris"" vs ""bristol"". Although ""bris"" might be an abbreviation for Bristol, the criterion allows approximate semantics or links to the same entity.  
  - ""bris.ac.uk"" is not the official Bristol URL; ""bristol.ac.uk"" is official. ""bris.ac.uk"" does not resolve or is not the same as ""bristol.ac.uk"". So the response is not pointing to the exact entity.  
  So, this is not acceptable. Score 0

  Response includes Chinese characters 曼彻斯特 in the URL, which is not the same URL or entity as ""manchester.ac.uk"". This is not an equivalent URL and likely won't resolve correctly. So not accepted under the criterion. Score 0

  Target: https://warwick.ac.uk/  
  ""www2"" is a subdomain and different from ""www"" or no www. Normally ""www2"" often points to the same site but can be different. The criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
  Check if ""www2.warwick.ac.uk"" is the same entity as warwick.ac.uk: likely yes, being a subdomain of warwick.ac.uk  
  Since it's the same entity, approximate with www or numeric www is acceptable. Score 1

- idx_11: Response: https://www曼彻斯特.ac.uk/  
  Target: https://manchester.ac.uk/  
  Response includes Chinese characters 曼彻斯特 in the URL, which is not the same URL or entity as ""manchester.ac.uk"". This is not an equivalent URL and likely won't resolve correctly. So not accepted under the criterion. Score 0

  Same entity, www difference. Score 1

- idx_15: Same as above, same again, Score 1

- idx_16: Response: https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/  
  Target: https://warwick.ac.uk/  
  ""www2"" is a subdomain and different from ""www"" or no www. Normally ""www2"" often points to the same site but can be different. The criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
  Check if ""www2.warwick.ac.uk"" is the same entity as warwick.ac.uk: likely yes, being a subdomain of warwick.ac.uk  
  Since it's the same entity, approximate with www or numeric www is acceptable. Score 1
