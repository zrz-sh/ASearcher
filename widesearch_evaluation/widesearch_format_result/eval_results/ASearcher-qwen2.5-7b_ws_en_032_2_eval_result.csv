**idx_0**:  
- Response: ""central""  
- Target: ""northshore&westernlines""  
These are clearly different lines, different names, different directions. ""central"" line is not the same entity as ""northshore&westernlines"". This is incorrect.  
Score: 0

**idx_1**:  
- Response: ""northern""  
- Target: ""leppington&innerwestline""  
""Northern"" and ""leppington&innerwestline"" are different; ""northern"" line is a specific line, but ""leppington"" and ""innerwestline"" are different lines. Not semantically same.  
Score: 0

**idx_2**:  
- Response: ""western""  
- Target: ""liverpool&innerwestline""  
""Western"" and ""liverpool&innerwestline"" are not equivalent. Liverpool line is distinct from a line simply called ""western"" and innerwestline is a different line from western line.  
Score: 0

**idx_3**:

**idx_7**:  
- Response: ""t1""  
- Target: ""airport&southline""  
""T1"" line includes Airport & South Line (T1 is an official designation including Airport & South). So ""t1"" and ""airport&southline"" can be considered approximately the same.
