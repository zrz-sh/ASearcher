### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.

Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.

  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:

  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

Target: ""zen"" (reference answer is ""zen"").  

Responses:

  - Exactly the same as target. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_7 to idx_11: response = ""zen+""  
  - ""zen+"" is a variation or an extended form but still points semantically to the ""zen"" family. It is closely related, likely a version or minor upgrade. Given criterion says approx semantics is enough, ""zen+"" points to the same entity (the zen architecture). Score = 1.  
  
- idx_12 to idx_19: response = ""zen2""  
  - ""zen2"" is a next generation or different version of ""zen"". While not exactly ""zen"", but it is part of the same lineage and commonly referred to as ""Zen architecture generation 2"". Points to the same entity broadly. According to criterion on approximate semantic equivalence pointing to the same entity, ""zen2"" counts as equivalent. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_20: ""zen3+""  
  - Same logic as above. It's a further version / extended version of zen. Semantically pointing to zen family, hence acceptable. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_21: ""zen3+3dv-cache""  
  - More detailed version, still within the Zen family architecture. The additional ""3dv-cache"" is a feature but overall referencing same entity family. Same semantic entity. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_22 to idx_26: ""zen3""  
  - A version of zen, same reasoning. Points to same entity family. Score = 1.

  - Same as idx_21. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_28: ""zen33dv-cache""  
  - Likely a slight typo or formatting difference but still clearly points to zen3 with 3dv-cache. Semantically same entity family. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_29 to idx_34: ""zen4""  
  - Newer generation of zen architecture family, still points to same entity. Score = 1.

  - Same as idx_28, semantic match. Score = 1.

Summary:  
All responses approximate the same semantic entity ""zen"" or a direct lineage/version of it. Based on criterion, they all get score = 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

Target: ""zen"" (reference answer is ""zen"").

  - ""zen2"" is a next generation or different version of ""zen"". While not exactly ""zen"", but it is part of the same lineage and commonly referred to as ""Zen architecture generation 2"".

  - Same logic as above. It's a further version / extended version of zen. Semantically pointing to zen family, hence acceptable. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_21: ""zen3+3dv-cache""  
  - More detailed version, still within the Zen family architecture. The additional ""3dv-cache"" is a feature but overall referencing same entity family. Same semantic entity. Score = 1.

  - Likely a slight typo or formatting difference but still clearly points to zen3 with 3dv-cache. Semantically same entity family. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_29 to idx_34: ""zen4""  
  - Newer generation of zen architecture family, still points to same entity. Score = 1.

Summary:  
All responses approximate the same semantic entity ""zen"" or a direct lineage/version of it. Based on criterion, they all get score = 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

Target: ""zen"" (reference answer is ""zen"").

- idx_7 to idx_11: response = ""zen+""  
  - ""zen+"" is a variation or an extended form but still points semantically to the ""zen"" family. It is closely related, likely a version or minor upgrade. Given criterion says approx semantics is enough, ""zen+"" points to the same entity (the zen architecture). Score = 1.

  - ""zen2"" is a next generation or different version of ""zen"". While not exactly ""zen"", but it is part of the same lineage and commonly referred to as ""Zen architecture generation 2"".

  - Same logic as above. It's a further version / extended version of zen. Semantically pointing to zen family, hence acceptable. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_21: ""zen3+3dv-cache""  
  - More detailed version, still within the Zen family architecture. The additional ""3dv-cache"" is a feature but overall referencing same entity family. Same semantic entity. Score = 1.

  - Likely a slight typo or formatting difference but still clearly points to zen3 with 3dv-cache. Semantically same entity family. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_29 to idx_34: ""zen4""  
  - Newer generation of zen architecture family, still points to same entity. Score = 1.

Summary:  
All responses approximate the same semantic entity ""zen"" or a direct lineage/version of it. Based on criterion, they all get score = 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

  - Same logic as above. It's a further version / extended version of zen. Semantically pointing to zen family, hence acceptable. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_21: ""zen3+3dv-cache""  
  - More detailed version, still within the Zen family architecture. The additional ""3dv-cache"" is a feature but overall referencing same entity family. Same semantic entity. Score = 1.

  - Newer generation of zen architecture family, still points to same entity. Score = 1.

Summary:  
All responses approximate the same semantic entity ""zen"" or a direct lineage/version of it. Based on criterion, they all get score = 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.

  - ""zen+"" is a variation or an extended form but still points semantically to the ""zen"" family. It is closely related, likely a version or minor upgrade. Given criterion says approx semantics is enough, ""zen+"" points to the same entity (the zen architecture). Score = 1.

  - ""zen2"" is a next generation or different version of ""zen"". While not exactly ""zen"", but it is part of the same lineage and commonly referred to as ""Zen architecture generation 2"".

  - Same logic as above. It's a further version / extended version of zen. Semantically pointing to zen family, hence acceptable. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_21: ""zen3+3dv-cache""  
  - More detailed version, still within the Zen family architecture. The additional ""3dv-cache"" is a feature but overall referencing same entity family. Same semantic entity. Score = 1.

  - Likely a slight typo or formatting difference but still clearly points to zen3 with 3dv-cache. Semantically same entity family. Score = 1.  
  
- idx_29 to idx_34: ""zen4""  
  - Newer generation of zen architecture family, still points to same entity. Score = 1.

Summary:  
All responses approximate the same semantic entity ""zen"" or a direct lineage/version of it. Based on criterion, they all get score = 1.

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_35 to idx_37:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard'  
  Responses: '-' → no match → 0

### Analysis

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Targets mostly are 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™vega3graphics'.  
  Responses are mostly '-', which likely means no or empty response. Since the response is not approximately the same as the target, and does not point to the same entity, score = 0.

- idx_8:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  'vega8' points to 'radeon™vega8graphics', so this is acceptable. Score =1

- idx_9 to idx_13:  
  Most responses: '-', targets mostly 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard' or 'radeon™rxvega10graphics' or 'radeon™vega3graphics', but response is '-' (empty) → no semantic match, score=0

- idx_14 to idx_17:  
  Same pattern: target 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response '-'. No match → 0

- idx_18:  
  Target: 'radeon™rxvega11graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon RX Vega 11 and Vega 8 are not exactly the same, but 'vega8' response points roughly to a similar kind of Vega graphics series. However, different model numbers may mean different entities. Let's check if this is considered ""approximately the same"". The criterion allows approximate semantic or same entity. Vega 8 vs Rx Vega 11 are different in AMD's naming. Therefore, probably score=0.

- idx_19:  
  Target: 'radeon™vega8graphics'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Clearly semantically the same—score=1

- idx_20 to idx_25:  
  Targets: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-'. No match → 0

- idx_26:  
  Target: 'radeon™graphics'  
  Response: 'vega7'  
  Vega 7 is a specific Radeon graphics. Since Vega 7 is part of Radeon graphics family, this is approximately the same or at least points to the same entity family. Per criterion, this should be okay. Score=1.

- idx_27 to idx_28:  
  Target: 'requiresdiscretegraphicscard', response: '-' → 0

- idx_29:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

- idx_30:  
  Target: 'amdradeon™610m'  
  Response: 'vega8'  
  Radeon 610M and Vega 8 are different GPUs. 'Vega8' is an onboard integrated GPU, Radeon 610M is a discrete older generation mobile GPU. Likely not the same entity. So score=0.

- idx_31 to idx_34:  
  Targets: 'amdradeon™610m' or 'amdradeon™graphics'  
  Responses: '-'  
  No semantic match → 0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.

---

### Analysis:

**idx_0 to idx_7:**  
- Response: ""14""  
- Target: ""14nm""  
- ""14"" and ""14nm"" effectively denote the same semiconductor node size, ""14nm"".  
- Score = 1

**idx_8:**  
- Response: ""14""  
- Target: ""14nmfinfet""  
- ""14"" and ""14nmfinfet"" are both referring to the 14nm node FinFET process - response is less descriptive but semantically the same entity.  
- Score = 1

**idx_9 to idx_11:**  
- Response: ""14""  
- Target: ""12nmfinfet""  
- Response ""14"" does not approximate or points to 12nm FinFET, they are different process nodes.  
- Score = 0

**idx_12:**  
- Response: ""7nm""  
- Target: ""12nm""  
- Different nodes, so no semantic equivalence.  
- Score = 0

**idx_13:**  
- Response: ""7nm""  
- Target: ""14nm""  
- Different nodes.  
- Score = 0

**idx_14 to idx_17:**  
- Response: ""7nm""  
- Target: ""tsmc7nmfinfet""  
- Response ""7nm"" approximately the same as ""tsmc7nmfinfet"", both refer to 7nm FinFET node by TSMC.  
- Score = 1

**idx_18 to idx_19:**  
- Response: ""7nm""  
- Target: ""12nmfinfet""  
- Different nodes.  
- Score = 0

**idx_20 to idx_28:**  
- Response: ""7nm""  
- Target: ""tsmc7nmfinfet""  
- Same as above: 7nm ≈ tsmc7nmfinfet  
- Score = 1

**idx_29 to idx_31:**  
- Response: ""5nm""  
- Target: ""tsmc6nmfinfet""  
- Different nodes (5nm vs 6nm). Not semantically the same.  
- Score = 0

**idx_32 to idx_34:**  
- Response: ""5nm""  
- Target: ""tsmc5nmfinfet""  
- Equivalent.  
- Score = 1

**idx_35 to idx_36:**  
- Response: ""7nm""  
- Target: ""tsmc7nmfinfet""  
- Equivalent.  
- Score = 1

**idx_37:**  
- Response: ""5nm""  
- Target: ""tsmc5nmfinfet""  
- Equivalent.  
- Score = 1

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

- The response for each idx is simply ""ryzen"".
- The target answers are specific Ryzen series (e.g., ryzen1000series, ryzenthreadripper1000series, ryzen2000series, etc.).
- ""ryzen"" is a broad term which includes all Ryzen series, as Ryzen is the series name itself.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, and ""ryzen"" directly corresponds to all the given target Ryzen series, the responses should be considered correct.
- No difference between ""ryzen"" and the specific series name implies loss of specificity but does not lead to incorrectness as per the criterion.
- Hence, all responses should be scored as 1.
