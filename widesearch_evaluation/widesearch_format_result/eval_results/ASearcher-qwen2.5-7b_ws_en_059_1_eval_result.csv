**idx_4**  
Response: ""mywish:aglobalnetworkofoceanprotectors""  
Target: ""mywish:protectouroceans""  
Are these approximately the same or do they point to the same entity?  
- Response: explicitly ""a global network of ocean protectors""  
- Target: ""protect our oceans""  
Semantically, ""a global network of ocean protectors"" could be a specific way to protect oceans, but target is more generic (""protect our oceans""). Given criterion: ""approximately the same or point to same entity.""  
These appear related but not exactly the same entity. The response refers to a ""network"" while the target is a general wish to protect oceans. Without additional context, these are not exactly the same entity or meaning. So according to the criterion, they are distinct.
