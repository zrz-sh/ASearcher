Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity; no need for exact word matching.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""sjmholdings""  
- Target: ""sociedadedejogosdemacau,s.a.(sjmresorts)""  
Analysis:  
- The target refers to a specific entity, translated as Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A. (SJM Resorts).  
- Response ""sjmholdings"" seems to refer to an entity related to SJM – possibly ""SJM Holdings Limited"" which is commonly the parent company of SJM Resorts. The response is a known entity related to SJM Resorts, but is it equivalent or similar enough?  
- Since the criterion states it is sufficient if semantics approximately match or point to the same entity, and given that ""SJM Holdings"" and ""SJM Resorts"" are closely linked, it can be accepted as correct, because both refer to major SJM entities in Macau.  
Verdict: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""wynnmacau""  
- Target: ""wynnmacau,limited""  
Analysis:  
- The response is ""wynnmacau"" which is the core entity referenced in the target ""wynnmacau,limited.""  
- This clearly points to the same entity, only the term ""limited"" is missing in the response.  
- Per criterion, approximate semantic match is sufficient.  
Verdict: 1

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""mgmchinaholdings""  
- Target: ""galaxyentertainmentgrouplimited""  
Analysis:  
- Response refers to ""MGM China Holdings"" (likely MGM China Holdings Limited), which is a distinct company.  
- Target refers to ""Galaxy Entertainment Group Limited,"" a different company altogether.  
- These are two separate entities in Macau gaming industry, so they are NOT semantically approximate or pointing to the same entity.  
Verdict: 0
