1. Given data:
- Standard answers (targets) and responses are all shown as '/' for each idx (idx_0, idx_1, idx_2).
- The criterion states that responses should be judged 0 or 1 based on whether the response semantics are roughly the same or pointing to the same entity as the target. Exact wording is not required.
- The scoring is 0 or 1 only.

2. Analysis per idx:
- idx_0: response = '/', target = '/'
  They are exactly the same symbol.

- idx_1: response = '/', target = '/'

Criterion: The response and the target need only to be semantically roughly the same or refer to the same entity, no need for word-for-word match.

Given pairs:

1. idx_0: response '/' vs target '/'  
   Both are exactly the same symbol '/', so they match perfectly.

2. idx_1: response '/' vs target '日本' (Japan)  
   '/' is not semantically similar or referring to '日本'. They differ completely.

3. idx_2: response '/' vs target '李宗伟' (Lee Chong Wei, a famous badminton player)  
   '/' again does not correspond semantically or entity-wise with '李宗伟'.

Scoring each:

- idx_0: 1 (perfect match)
- idx_1: 0 (no match)
- idx_2: 0 (no match)

1. idx_0:
   - target: '/'
   - response: '/'
   - 语义上，两者完全一致，都是斜杠，且指向同一实体。
   - 得分：1

2. idx_1:
   - target: '3:2'
   - response: '/'
   - 语义不一致，target 是比分 ""3:2""，response 是斜杠 '/'
   - 得分：0

3. idx_2:
   - target: '15-21,21-11,22-20'
   - response: '/'
   - 语义不一致，target 是比分集合，response 是斜杠 '/'

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
Translated: The meaning should be roughly the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity; exact word-by-word correspondence is not required.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""世界"" (World)  
- Target: ""世界锦标赛"" (World Championship)  
Analysis: The response ""世界"" is a part of the target ""世界锦标赛."" The response is more general (just ""world"") while the target refers to a specific event ""world championship."" However, since the response is a subset conceptually and points to the broader same domain (""world""), it can be said to roughly match the target’s domain/entity. Under the criterion, rough semantic matching is sufficient.  
Verdict: Acceptable → score 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""团体"" (Team/Group)  
- Target: ""苏杯混团锦标赛"" (Sudirman Cup Mixed Team Championship)  
Analysis: The response ""团体"" means ""team,"" which is a part of the target (which is a mixed team championship). The response captures the entity ""team,"" which is a key concept of the target answer. Although less specific, the entity pointed to is consistent.  
Verdict: Acceptable → score 1

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""世界"" (World)  
- Target: ""奥运会"" (Olympic Games)  
Analysis: ""世界"" means ""world,"" which is very general, while the target is the specific event ""Olympic Games."" The response does not point directly to the same event. The criterion says roughly the same meaning or points to the same entity. Here ""世界"" is too generic and does not specify the Olympics or any event related to it. Thus, it does not meet the criterion.  
Verdict: Not acceptable → score 0

---

**idx_0**:  
- Response: 冠军 (Champion)  
- Target: 32强 (Top 32)  
Analysis: ""Champion"" refers to the winner of the whole tournament, while ""32强"" refers to the top 32 teams or players. These are clearly different stages/ranks and entities in competition hierarchy. They do not have the same or similar semantic meaning.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_1**:  
- Response: 冠军 (Champion)  
- Target: 亚军 (Runner-up)  
Analysis: ""Champion"" and ""Runner-up"" are different ranks. Champion means the first place, while runner-up is second place. These are distinct entities. They are not semantically same or similar enough to be considered equivalent.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_2**:  
- Response: 冠军 (Champion)  
- Target: 4强 (Top 4)  
Analysis: ""Champion"" (winner) is one entity within the ""Top 4"" subset. They are close in hierarchy but not the same entity. The target is a group of four, the response is one winner within that group. According to criterion, pointing to the same entity or roughly same semantic is required, so this is not sufficient.

- idx_0:

  - Score: 1

- idx_1:

  - Target: ""苏杯""  
  - The response ""男单"" means ""Men's singles"" and the target ""苏杯"" refers to the ""Sudirman Cup"" (a mixed team badminton tournament). These are clearly different entities/concepts.  
  - Since the criterion requires semantic similarity or the same entity, and here there's no such match, the score should be 0.
