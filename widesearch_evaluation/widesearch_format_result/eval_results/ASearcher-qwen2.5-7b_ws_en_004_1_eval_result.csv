**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""1440x2560""  
- Target: ""2560x1440""  
These are the same numbers but swapped dimensions. Typically, screen resolution is given as width x height. If the response reverses these dimensions, it may imply different screen orientation or is just swapped. Since the two values point to the same numbers but swapped, this is likely a different resolution. So not the same entity or approximate semantics. Hence, score: 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""1440x2560""  
- Target: ""2560×1440"" (just a different ""x"" character)  
As above, just swapped dimensions. Same analysis as idx_0, score: 0

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""2960x1440""  
- Target: ""3040x1440""  
Difference in width by 80 pixels. Although close, it's not the same resolution. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, but this is a difference in one dimension by a not insignificant margin. This may be considered different enough to score 0.

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""2400x1080""  
- Target: ""3200×1440""  
Different dimensions entirely. Not the same or approximate. Score: 0

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""2400x1080""  
- Target: ""2340x1080""  
Difference in width by 60 pixels, height same. Slightly off, but close. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity is sufficient. However, 60 pixels difference could be a different resolution.  
But might be considered approximate? Let's see: 2400 vs 2340, a minor difference. Could be a typo or rounding. They probably refer to the same class of screen resolution (FHD+ variant). Given the criterion is lenient, we can score this as 1.

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""1440x2560""  
- Target: ""2560x1440""  
These are the same numbers but swapped dimensions. Typically, screen resolution is given as width x height. If the response reverses these dimensions, it may imply different screen orientation or is just swapped. Since the two values point to the same numbers but swapped, this is likely a different resolution. So not the same entity or approximate semantics. Hence, score: 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""1440x2560""  
- Target: ""2560×1440"" (just a different ""x"" character)  
As above, just swapped dimensions. Same analysis as idx_0, score: 0

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""2960x1440""  
- Target: ""3040x1440""  
Difference in width by 80 pixels. Although close, it's not the same resolution. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, but this is a difference in one dimension by a not insignificant margin. This may be considered different enough to score 0.

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""2400x1080""  
- Target: ""3200×1440""  
Different dimensions entirely. Not the same or approximate. Score: 0

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""2400x1080""  
- Target: ""2340x1080""  
Difference in width by 60 pixels, height same. Slightly off, but close. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity is sufficient. However, 60 pixels difference could be a different resolution.  
But might be considered approximate? Let's see: 2400 vs 2340, a minor difference. Could be a typo or rounding. They probably refer to the same class of screen resolution (FHD+ variant). Given the criterion is lenient, we can score this as 1.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""exynos5430/snapdragon810""  
- Target: ""exynos7420""  
- The response lists exynos5430 and snapdragon810. The target is exynos7420 only. The response does not mention exynos7420 or snapdragon related to the target. So this does not match semantically to the reference answer.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""exynos8890/snapdragon820""  
- Target: ""snapdragon820""  
- The response includes snapdragon820 and exynos8890, target is snapdragon820 only. Including extra is acceptable as long as core entity is included. Here, the core part ""snapdragon820"" is present in response. Matches semantically.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**

Criterion restated:  
- The response semantics should approximately match the reference answer or point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word matching.  
- Scoring is binary (0 or 1).

**idx_0**  
- Response: android5.0.2  
- Target: android5  
Analysis: The response ""android5.0.2"" is a more specific version within the Android 5 series. It points to the same major entity as ""android5"".  
Judgment: Same entity → Score = 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: android6.0  
- Target: android6  
Analysis: The response matches the target's major version exactly.  
Judgment: Same entity → Score = 1

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: android10.0  
- Target: android9  
Analysis: These are different major versions, android10 is newer than android9. Not approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.  
Judgment: Different → Score = 0

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: android10.0  
- Target: android10  
Analysis: Exact match in semantics (android10.0 and android10 equivalent).  
Judgment: Same → Score = 1

---

**idx_4**  
- Response: android14.0  
- Target: android13  
Analysis: Different major versions, android14 != android13. Not matching same entity.  
Judgment: Different → Score = 0

---

**idx_5**  
- Response: android16.0  
- Target: android15  
Analysis: Different major versions, no semantic equivalence here.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""1440x2560""  
- Target: ""2560x1440""  
These are the same numbers but swapped dimensions. Typically, screen resolution is given as width x height. If the response reverses these dimensions, it may imply different screen orientation or is just swapped. Since the two values point to the same numbers but swapped, this is likely a different resolution. So not the same entity or approximate semantics. Hence, score: 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""1440x2560""  
- Target: ""2560×1440"" (just a different ""x"" character)  
As above, just swapped dimensions. Same analysis as idx_0, score: 0

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""2960x1440""  
- Target: ""3040x1440""  
Difference in width by 80 pixels. Although close, it's not the same resolution. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, but this is a difference in one dimension by a not insignificant margin. This may be considered different enough to score 0.

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""2400x1080""  
- Target: ""3200×1440""  
Different dimensions entirely. Not the same or approximate. Score: 0

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""2400x1080""  
- Target: ""2340x1080""  
Difference in width by 60 pixels, height same. Slightly off, but close. The criterion says approximate semantics or same entity is sufficient. However, 60 pixels difference could be a different resolution.  
But might be considered approximate? Let's see: 2400 vs 2340, a minor difference. Could be a typo or rounding. They probably refer to the same class of screen resolution (FHD+ variant). Given the criterion is lenient, we can score this as 1.  

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""2400x1080""  
- Target: ""2340x1080""  
Same as idx_4, with same reasoning. Score: 1
