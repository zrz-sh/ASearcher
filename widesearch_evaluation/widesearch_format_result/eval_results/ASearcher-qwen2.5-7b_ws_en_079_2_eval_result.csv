**Item idx_0:**

- **Target:** wynnmacau,limited
- **Response:** sjmholdings

Analysis:
- The standard answer mentions ""wynnmacau,limited,"" which is a known entity related to Wynn Macau company.
- The response is ""sjmholdings,"" which refers to a different holding company (SJM Holdings).
- These two entities are distinct and not semantically equivalent.
- The response does not match the target or point to the same entity.
- Result: 0

**Item idx_1:**

- **Target:** mgmchinaholdingslimited
- **Response:** mgmchinaholdings

Analysis:
- The target is ""mgmchinaholdingslimited,"" and the response is ""mgmchinaholdings.""
- The response is the same name as the target but without the word ""limited."" 
- According to the grading criteria: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.""
- Dropping ""limited"" does not change the entity referred to; it clearly points to the same entity.
- Therefore, this response should be considered correct.
- Result: 1
