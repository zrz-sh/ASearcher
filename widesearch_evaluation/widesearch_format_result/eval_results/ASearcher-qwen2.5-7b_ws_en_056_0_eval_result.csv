### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
Response = target exactly the same (adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton)  
Score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_2:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_3:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Response is missing shakira, usher and has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera instead. So 2 names don't match, only 2 overlap (adamlevine, blakeshelton)  
Since the criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, and half the names differ, this should be scored as 0.

**idx_4:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_3, so score = 0

**idx_6:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera; target has gwenstefani and pharrellwilliams. Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap.  
Again, half mismatch indicates no approximate semantic equivalence. Score = 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams, but three names overlap (adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton).

Since 3/4 match, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence, this should get a 1.

**idx_8:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Same as idx_6, only two names overlap, two differ. Score = 0

**idx_9:**  
Response same as before

Same as idx_7, 3/4 match, so score = 1

**idx_10:**

Response missing mileycyrus and aliciakeys and instead has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera.

Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_11:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Two mismatches (gwenstefani and aliciakeys vs ceelogreen and christinaaguilera)  
Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap, so score = 0

**idx_12:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton

Again, only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_13:**

Each pair's ""response"" is 'nan', meaning no answer is given.

Each pair's ""target"" contains multiple song titles with labels like (solosong), (duetsong(withcoach)), (originalsong), (reprisesong), or (christmassong).

Grading criteria:

- The semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

- If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference, all must be included.

Since the response is 'nan' in every case, the response does not include any of the multiple songs required.

Therefore, for all idx_xxx pairs, the response is completely missing.

Hence score: 0 for all pairs.

No need for partial credit since only 0 or 1 is allowed.

Each pair's ""response"" is 'nan', meaning no answer is given.

Each pair's ""target"" contains multiple song titles with labels like (solosong), (duetsong(withcoach)), (originalsong), (reprisesong), or (christmassong).

Grading criteria:

- The semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

- If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference, all must be included.

Since the response is 'nan' in every case, the response does not include any of the multiple songs required.

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
Response = target exactly the same (adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton)  
Score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_2:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_3:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Response is missing shakira, usher and has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera instead. So 2 names don't match, only 2 overlap (adamlevine, blakeshelton)  
Since the criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, and half the names differ, this should be scored as 0.

**idx_4:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_3, so score = 0

**idx_6:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera; target has gwenstefani and pharrellwilliams. Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap.  
Again, half mismatch indicates no approximate semantic equivalence. Score = 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams, but three names overlap (adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton).

Since 3/4 match, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence, this should get a 1.

**idx_8:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Same as idx_6, only two names overlap, two differ. Score = 0

**idx_9:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_7, 3/4 match, so score = 1

**idx_10:**  
Response same as before

Response missing mileycyrus and aliciakeys and instead has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera.

Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_11:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Two mismatches (gwenstefani and aliciakeys vs ceelogreen and christinaaguilera)  
Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap, so score = 0

**idx_12:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton

Again, only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_13:**

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
Response = target exactly the same (adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton)  
Score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_2:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_3:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Response is missing shakira, usher and has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera instead. So 2 names don't match, only 2 overlap (adamlevine, blakeshelton)  
Since the criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, and half the names differ, this should be scored as 0.

**idx_4:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_3, so score = 0

**idx_6:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera; target has gwenstefani and pharrellwilliams. Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap.  
Again, half mismatch indicates no approximate semantic equivalence. Score = 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams, but three names overlap (adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton).

Since 3/4 match, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence, this should get a 1.

**idx_8:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Same as idx_6, only two names overlap, two differ. Score = 0

**idx_9:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_7, 3/4 match, so score = 1

**idx_10:**

Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Response missing mileycyrus and aliciakeys and instead has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera.

Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_11:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Two mismatches (gwenstefani and aliciakeys vs ceelogreen and christinaaguilera)  
Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap, so score = 0

**idx_12:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton

Again, only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_13:**

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
Response = target exactly the same (adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton)  
Score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_2:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_3:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Response is missing shakira, usher and has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera instead. So 2 names don't match, only 2 overlap (adamlevine, blakeshelton)  
Since the criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, and half the names differ, this should be scored as 0.

**idx_4:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_3, so score = 0

**idx_6:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera; target has gwenstefani and pharrellwilliams. Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap.  
Again, half mismatch indicates no approximate semantic equivalence. Score = 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams, but three names overlap (adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton).

Since 3/4 match, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence, this should get a 1.

**idx_8:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Same as idx_6, only two names overlap, two differ. Score = 0

**idx_9:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_7, 3/4 match, so score = 1

**idx_10:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Response missing mileycyrus and aliciakeys and instead has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera.

Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_11:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Two mismatches (gwenstefani and aliciakeys vs ceelogreen and christinaaguilera)  
Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap, so score = 0

**idx_12:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton

Again, only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_13:**

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
Response = target exactly the same (adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton)  
Score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_2:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_3:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Response is missing shakira, usher and has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera instead. So 2 names don't match, only 2 overlap (adamlevine, blakeshelton)  
Since the criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, and half the names differ, this should be scored as 0.

**idx_4:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Same as idx_3, so score = 0

**idx_6:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera; target has gwenstefani and pharrellwilliams. Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap.  
Again, half mismatch indicates no approximate semantic equivalence. Score = 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams, but three names overlap (adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton).

Since 3/4 match, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence, this should get a 1.

**idx_8:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Same as idx_6, only two names overlap, two differ. Score = 0

**idx_9:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_7, 3/4 match, so score = 1

**idx_10:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Response missing mileycyrus and aliciakeys and instead has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera.

Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_11:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Two mismatches (gwenstefani and aliciakeys vs ceelogreen and christinaaguilera)  
Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap, so score = 0

**idx_12:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton

Again, only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_13:**

Grading criteria:

- The semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
Response = target exactly the same (adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton)  
Score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_2:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_3:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Response is missing shakira, usher and has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera instead. So 2 names don't match, only 2 overlap (adamlevine, blakeshelton)  
Since the criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, and half the names differ, this should be scored as 0.

**idx_4:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Same as idx_3, so score = 0

**idx_6:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera; target has gwenstefani and pharrellwilliams. Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap.  
Again, half mismatch indicates no approximate semantic equivalence. Score = 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams, but three names overlap (adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton).

Since 3/4 match, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence, this should get a 1.

**idx_8:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Same as idx_6, only two names overlap, two differ. Score = 0

**idx_9:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_7, 3/4 match, so score = 1

**idx_10:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Response missing mileycyrus and aliciakeys and instead has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera.

Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_11:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Two mismatches (gwenstefani and aliciakeys vs ceelogreen and christinaaguilera)  
Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap, so score = 0

**idx_12:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton

Again, only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_13:**

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
Response = target exactly the same (adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton)  
Score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_2:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_3:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Response is missing shakira, usher and has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera instead. So 2 names don't match, only 2 overlap (adamlevine, blakeshelton)  
Since the criterion says approximate semantics or same entity, and half the names differ, this should be scored as 0.

**idx_4:**  
Same as idx_0, exact match.  
Score = 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,shakira,usher,blakeshelton

Same as idx_3, so score = 0

**idx_6:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera; target has gwenstefani and pharrellwilliams. Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap.  
Again, half mismatch indicates no approximate semantic equivalence. Score = 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Response has ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams, but three names overlap (adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton).

Since 3/4 match, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence, this should get a 1.

**idx_8:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton

Same as idx_6, only two names overlap, two differ. Score = 0

**idx_9:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton

Same as idx_7, 3/4 match, so score = 1

**idx_10:**  
Response same as before  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Response missing mileycyrus and aliciakeys and instead has ceelogreen and christinaaguilera.

Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_11:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,aliciakeys,blakeshelton

Two mismatches (gwenstefani and aliciakeys vs ceelogreen and christinaaguilera)  
Only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap, so score = 0

**idx_12:**  
Response same  
Target: adamlevine,mileycyrus,jenniferhudson,blakeshelton

Again, only adamlevine and blakeshelton overlap. Score = 0

**idx_13:**

Criterion recap:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.
- Response is ""nan"" in all cases here (string ""nan"").
- Target is a string representing a title or phrase.

For each idx:

- idx_0: response = ""nan"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  ""nan"" is not semantically close to ""timeaftertime"" nor pointing to the same entity. It's just the string ""nan"". So no match.

- idx_1: response = ""nan"", target = ""complicated""  
  Same reasoning as above. Not correct.

- idx_2: response = ""nan"", target = ""torn""  
  Same. Not correct.

- idx_3: response = ""nan"", target = ""mean""  
  Still no semantic or entity match.

- idx_4: response = ""nan"", target = ""try""  
  No match.

- idx_5: response = ""nan"", target = ""onemoretry""  
  No match.

- idx_6: response = ""nan"", target = ""thewhiskeyain'tworkin'""  
  No match.

- idx_7: response = ""nan"", target = ""i'mamanofconstantsorrow""  
  No match.

- idx_8: response = ""nan"", target = ""chandelier""  
  No match.

- idx_9: response = ""nan"", target = ""bluebayou""  
  No match.

- idx_10: response = ""nan"", target = ""i'vebeenlovingyoutoolong""  
  No match.

- idx_11: response = ""nan"", target = ""thetracksofmytears""  
  No match.

- idx_12: response = ""nan"", target = ""thechain""  
  No match.

- idx_13: response = ""nan"", target = ""beneathyourbeautiful""  
  No match.

All responses are just ""nan"" while targets are meaningful strings. Thus, no responses meet the criterion.

Final scoring:

Each pair's ""response"" is 'nan', meaning no answer is given.

Each pair's ""target"" contains multiple song titles with labels like (solosong), (duetsong(withcoach)), (originalsong), (reprisesong), or (christmassong).

Grading criteria:

- The semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

- If multiple pieces of music are provided in the reference, all must be included.

Since the response is 'nan' in every case, the response does not include any of the multiple songs required.

Therefore, for all idx_xxx pairs, the response is completely missing.

Hence score: 0 for all pairs.

No need for partial credit since only 0 or 1 is allowed.

Final scores:

```json
{
  ""idx_0"": 0,
  ""idx_1"": 0,
  ""idx_2"": 0,
  ""idx_3"": 0,
