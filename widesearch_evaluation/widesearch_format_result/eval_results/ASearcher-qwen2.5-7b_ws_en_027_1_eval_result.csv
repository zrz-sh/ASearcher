,,royalmuseumsgreenwich,Royal Museums Greenwich,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair step-by-step according to the criterion:

Criterion summary: It's sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No exact word-for-word match is required.

---

### idx_0
- Target: ""parkrow,greenwich,london,gb""
- Response: ""parkrow,greenwichse109nf""

Analysis:
- Both mention ""parkrow"" and ""greenwich"".
- The response contains a postcode-like suffix ""se109nf"" which is consistent with Greenwich area in London.
- Both point to the same location/entity: Park Row, Greenwich, London.
- No contradiction or mismatch in general semantics.

Conclusion: Semantics approximately the same / point to same entity → Score = 1

---

### idx_1
- Target: ""birdgcagewalk,london,gb""
- Response: ""1queenvictoriastreet,londonec4v4ay""

Analysis:
- The target is ""birdgcagewalk"", the response is ""1queenvictoriastreet"".
- Both located in London, but completely different street names.
- No semantic equivalence or common entity.
- Just both being addresses in London is too generic; they do not point to the same entity.

Conclusion: Not the same or approximately the same semantics → Score = 0

---

### idx_2
- Target: ""lambethpalaceroad,londonse17lb""
- Response: ""100lambethhighst,londonse17lp""

Analysis:
- Target: Lambeth Palace Road.
- Response: Lambeth High Street.
- Both locations are in Lambeth, London SE1 area.
- Different streets—palace road vs. high street.
- Possibly close geographically but distinct streets.
- The criterion requires approximate semantics or same entity; streets are distinct entities.
- Not equivalent semantically or pointing to the same entity.

Conclusion: Score = 0
