- Score: 1

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""louye""  
- Target: ""yelou""  
- Different spelling; the order of characters is switched.  
- Are they pointing to the same entity? The entities are probably name-like tokens. Given that the characters are the same but reversed, this suggests they are different. The criterion says ""semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity,"" which suggests that a simple reversal wouldn't be considered the same entity.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""romanpolanski""  
- Target: ""romanpolanski""  
- Exact match: Yes  
- Score: 1

Criterion summary:
- Semantics approximately the same as the reference or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- Only relevance to the reference answer matters.
- Different classification inconsistencies are allowed.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""drama""  
- Target: ""drama""  
- Exact match, clearly correct.  
→ Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""drama""  
- Target: ""drama""  
- Exact match.  
→ Score: 1

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""drama""  
- Target: ""drama/thriller/crime""  
- Response only mentions ""drama"" which is part of the target answer (drama + thriller + crime). The response points correctly to one of the genres in the target answer.  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
→ Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""drama""  
- Target: ""drama,thriller""  
- Response is ""drama"", target is ""drama, thriller"". The response is a subset of the target, and matches one of the entities.  
- This is sufficient per the criterion.  
→ Score: 1

Criterion:
- Semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- No need for exact word-for-word match, but the meaning must be the same.

Analysis:

- idx_0: response = ""106min"", target = ""106min""  
  Exact match. Score = 1

- idx_1: response = ""132min"", target = ""112min""  
  Different values, even though both are minutes. They point to different numbers, hence not semantically equal. Score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""122min"", target = ""118min""  
  Different values, no mention that close numeric values can be accepted. So no match. Score = 0

- idx_3: response = ""127min"", target = ""126min""  
  Different values, close but not equal and no tolerance mentioned. Score = 0

- idx_4: response = ""132min"", target = ""132min""  
  Exact match. Score = 1
