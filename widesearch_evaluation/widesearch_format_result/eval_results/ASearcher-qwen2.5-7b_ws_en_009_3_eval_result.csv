,,maculturalstudies,MA Cultural Studies,0.0,"exact not match, response: £22,000, target: £21,000","£21,000","£22,000",1.0,"Let's analyze each pair:

---

**Pair idx_0**  
- Target answer includes:  
  - ""culturalstudiesandcapitalism""  
  - ""30credits""  
  - ""doingculturalstudies""  
  - ""30credits""  
  - ""maculturalstudiesdissertation(methodologyandresearch)""  
  - ""60credits""

- Response answer includes only:  
  - ""culturalstudiesandcapitalism""

**Analysis:**  
The response only mentions the first item of the target and misses the other two components (doing cultural studies 30 credits and the dissertation 60 credits). However, according to the criterion, ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity"" and ""It is acceptable if the corresponding scores are missing.""  

The response includes exactly the name of the first course item from the target, which matches exactly the first line of the target answer. The criterion states approximate semantic match or pointing to the same entity suffices, and missing scores is acceptable.  

The response missing other items might mean this is a partial answer, but since it points to a valid entity in the target answer, it is acceptable.

Therefore, **score = 1**

---

**Pair idx_1**  
- Target answer includes:  
  - ""introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory""  
  - ""30credits""  
  - ""dissertation""  
  - ""60credits""

- Response answer includes only:  
  - ""introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory""

**Analysis:**  
Same situation as idx_0. The response only includes the first course. Missing the credits and dissertation. Criterion says ""It is acceptable if the corresponding scores are missing""; point to the same entity suffices.  

Therefore, the response is acceptable and scores 1.

**Criterion:**  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Model outputting the calculated score (a number) is acceptable, even if target is an expression.

---

### Item idx_0:

- Target: ""30+30+60""  
- Response: ""180""  

Check if 30+30+60 equals 180:  
30 + 30 = 60, 60 + 60 = 120, not 180.

The response ""180"" is a different number than the sum of the target expression (which is 120). Since the semantics do not point to the same entity or semantic content, this is not acceptable.

Score: 0

---

### Item idx_1:

- Target: ""30+60""  
- Response: ""180""  

Check if 30+60 equals 180:  
30 + 60 = 90, not 180.

Again, the response output ""180"" does not correspond to the sum of the target expression or any equivalent semantic answer or entity.

**Pair idx_0:**
- Target: ""6.5witha6.5inwritingandnoelementlowerthan6.0""
- Response: ""overall6.5with6.5inwriting""

Analysis:
- The response indicates an overall score of 6.5 with a 6.5 in writing.
- The target says essentially the same: a 6.5 overall with 6.5 in writing.
- The target adds ""no element lower than 6.0,"" which is extra detail.
- According to the criterion, semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- The response does not contradict the target; it just omits the ""no element lower than 6.0.""
- This is acceptable since it captures the main semantic content (overall 6.5 with 6.5 in writing).

Score for idx_0: 1

---

**Pair idx_1:**
- Target: ""6.5witha6.5inwritingandnoelementlowerthan6.0""
- Response: ""overall7.0with7.0inwriting""

Analysis:
- The response indicates an overall score of 7.0 with 7.0 in writing.
- The target indicates an overall 6.5 with 6.5 in writing and no element lower than 6.0.
- The numbers are different, so semantics do NOT match.
- By the grading criterion, exact match is not required, but approximate semantic match or same entity is.
- Here, the score changed significantly from 6.5 to 7.0, which is not the same concept or value.
- This is essentially a mismatch.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same is sufficient.  
- Pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Word-for-word correspondence is NOT required.

### Analysis

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""1yearft/2yearspt""  
- Target: ""1yearfull-time""  

Comparison:  
- The target specifies a duration ""1 year"" and the employment status ""full-time.""  
- The response ""1yearft/2yearspt"" contains ""1yearft"" which stands for ""1 year full-time,"" and ""2yearspt"" which suggests ""2 years part-time.""  
- The response partially matches the target with ""1yearft"" included. However, the response also adds an alternative option ""2yearspt,"" which is not mentioned in the target.  
- Despite the extra info, the response does identify the entity ""1 year full-time"" approximately as in the target. According to the criterion, this is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Verdict: Score 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""1yearft/2yearspt""
