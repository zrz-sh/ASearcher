This means the response and the target (standard answer) need to be roughly semantically the same or point to the same entity. The response here is always 'nan', which likely means ""not a number"" or ""no answer,"" hence it is not the same or equivalent to the target entity.

Step-by-step analysis:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = '姚谦'  
  'nan' is not the same as the entity '姚谦'. No semantic match. Score = 0.

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'ashleyfulton、yejikim、lizbecker'  
  Again, 'nan' does not represent the entities listed. No match. Score = 0.

- idx_2: response = 'nan', target = '姜洄'  
  No semantic equivalence. Score = 0.

- idx_3: response = 'nan', target = 'in-k'  
  No equivalence. Score = 0.

- idx_4: response = 'nan', target = '农文鑫'  
  No equivalence. Score = 0.

Final results: all 0.

- idx_0  
  - Response: ""someonelikeyou""  
  - Target: ""嗨！人间""  
  - Judgment: ""someonelikeyou"" vs. ""嗨！人间"" are clearly different phrases, no semantic or entity relation apparent. Score: 0

- idx_1  
  - Response: ""奔腾""  
  - Target: ""crush""  
  - Judgment: ""奔腾"" means ""galloping"" or ""surging forward,"" while ""crush"" is an English word for someone you like or can refer to crushing physically. No semantic equivalence or entity relation. Score: 0

- idx_2  
  - Response: ""不会太晚"" (not too late)  
  - Target: ""跳楼机"" (drop tower ride)  
  - Judgment: The response is a phrase about timing; the target denotes a type of amusement ride. Different semantics and entities. Score: 0

- idx_3  
  - Response: ""不渝"" (unwavering, unchanging)  
  - Target: ""第57次取消发送"" (the 57th cancellation of send)

All responses do not match their targets semantically or in entity.

Translation: The response is acceptable as long as the meaning is roughly the same or it refers to the same entity; exact word-for-word matching is not needed.
