Criterion summary:  
- If the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, it is correct.  
- A one-year gap between the answer and the reference answer is allowed. (That means if |response - target| ≤ 1, score = 1 else 0)  
- Since both response and target are years, we just need to check if the numerical difference ≤ 1.
