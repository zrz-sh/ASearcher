**Criterion:**  
- Semantic equivalence is sufficient.  
- No need for exact word-for-word match.  
- If semantics are approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, score = 1.  

---

**Given:**  
- Target: ""165northclarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""  
- Response: ""165nclarkst,fresno,ca93701""

---

**Step 1: Compare the address number**  
- Both have ""165"" → match.

**Step 2: Compare street name.**  
- Target: ""northclarkstreet""  
- Response: ""nclarkst""  
- ""nclarkst"" is an abbreviation for ""north clark street."" ""n"" → north, ""clarkst"" → Clark Street. This is semantically equivalent to ""northclarkstreet.""

**Step 3: Compare city**  
- Both have ""fresno"" → match.

**Step 4: Compare state and zip**  
- Both have ""ca93701"" → match.

---

Since the response is a valid abbreviation of the address, and all entities match, the semantics are approximately the same and refer to the same entity.

**Result:** Score = 1

- Standard answer (target): ""closed""
- Response: ""closed""

According to the criterion:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
Since both the response and the target are exactly the same word ""closed"", the response fully meets the criterion.

Therefore, the score for this pair is **1**.
