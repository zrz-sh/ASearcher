Response: chiefjusticeoftheu.s.courtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit  
Target: judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit  
Analysis: ""Chief justice"" vs. ""judge"" – Chief justice is a specific role, a subset of judge, but it differs from a regular judge. The target is judge (likely circuit judge), not chief judge/chief justice. Different roles within the court. So, not same entity or meaning.

Response: associatejustice  
Target: associatejustice,u.s.supremecourt  
Analysis: Associate justice vs associate justice of U.S. Supreme Court. The target specifies Supreme Court; response is generic. Is ""associate justice"" alone sufficient here? Without court specified, it is ambiguous. But usually ""associate justice"" is commonly used to refer to the Supreme Court associate justice in many settings. Does it point to the same entity? Probably yes, since the context strongly implies the Supreme Court. The criterion says approximate semantics okay.

Analysis: ""Chief justice"" vs. ""judge"" – Chief justice is a specific role, a subset of judge, but it differs from a regular judge. The target is judge (likely circuit judge), not chief judge/chief justice. Different roles within the court. So, not same entity or meaning.

Response: associatejustice  
Target: associatejustice,u.s.supremecourt  
Analysis: Associate justice vs associate justice of U.S. Supreme Court. The target specifies Supreme Court; response is generic. Is ""associate justice"" alone sufficient here? Without court specified, it is ambiguous. But usually ""associate justice"" is commonly used to refer to the Supreme Court associate justice in many settings. Does it point to the same entity? Probably yes, since the context strongly implies the Supreme Court. The criterion says approximate semantics okay.

- However, in most contexts, the default ""bush"" might be assumed to mean George W. Bush. Based on the criterion, it's sufficient if they point to the same entity.  
- Given no further information, we have to judge whether ""bush"" is acceptable for ""georgew.bush"".

- However, in most contexts, the default ""bush"" might be assumed to mean George W. Bush. Based on the criterion, it's sufficient if they point to the same entity.  
- Given no further information, we have to judge whether ""bush"" is acceptable for ""georgew.bush"".

Target: judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit  
Analysis: ""Chief justice"" vs. ""judge"" – Chief justice is a specific role, a subset of judge, but it differs from a regular judge. The target is judge (likely circuit judge), not chief judge/chief justice. Different roles within the court. So, not same entity or meaning.

Response: associatejustice  
Target: associatejustice,u.s.supremecourt  
Analysis: Associate justice vs associate justice of U.S. Supreme Court. The target specifies Supreme Court; response is generic. Is ""associate justice"" alone sufficient here? Without court specified, it is ambiguous. But usually ""associate justice"" is commonly used to refer to the Supreme Court associate justice in many settings. Does it point to the same entity? Probably yes, since the context strongly implies the Supreme Court. The criterion says approximate semantics okay.

Response: chiefjusticeoftheu.s.courtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit  
Target: judgeoftheunitedstatescourtofappealsforthedistrictofcolumbiacircuit  
Analysis: ""Chief justice"" vs. ""judge"" – Chief justice is a specific role, a subset of judge, but it differs from a regular judge. The target is judge (likely circuit judge), not chief judge/chief justice. Different roles within the court. So, not same entity or meaning.  
Score: 0

**idx_3**  
Response: associatejustice  
Target: associatejustice,u.s.supremecourt  
Analysis: Associate justice vs associate justice of U.S. Supreme Court. The target specifies Supreme Court; response is generic. Is ""associate justice"" alone sufficient here? Without court specified, it is ambiguous. But usually ""associate justice"" is commonly used to refer to the Supreme Court associate justice in many settings. Does it point to the same entity? Probably yes, since the context strongly implies the Supreme Court. The criterion says approximate semantics okay.

- However, in most contexts, the default ""bush"" might be assumed to mean George W. Bush. Based on the criterion, it's sufficient if they point to the same entity.  
- Given no further information, we have to judge whether ""bush"" is acceptable for ""georgew.bush"".

Response: associatejustice  
Target: associatejustice,u.s.supremecourt  
Analysis: Associate justice vs associate justice of U.S. Supreme Court. The target specifies Supreme Court; response is generic. Is ""associate justice"" alone sufficient here? Without court specified, it is ambiguous. But usually ""associate justice"" is commonly used to refer to the Supreme Court associate justice in many settings. Does it point to the same entity?

- However, in most contexts, the default ""bush"" might be assumed to mean George W. Bush. Based on the criterion, it's sufficient if they point to the same entity.  
- Given no further information, we have to judge whether ""bush"" is acceptable for ""georgew.bush"".
