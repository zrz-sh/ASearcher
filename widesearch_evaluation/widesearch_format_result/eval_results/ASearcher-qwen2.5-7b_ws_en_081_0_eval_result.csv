baldur'sgate3,Baldur's Gate 3,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair step-by-step according to the provided criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

---

### idx_0:
- Response: ""nan""
- Target: ""nan""

Analysis:
- Both response and target are ""nan"".
- They match exactly in semantics.
- Score: 1

---

### idx_1:
- Response: ""nan""
- Target: ""armoredcorevi:firesofrubicon""

Analysis:
- Target is a specific string naming ""armoredcorevi:firesofrubicon"".
- Response is ""nan"".
- ""nan"" does not approximate or represent the target entity.
- Score: 0

---

### idx_2:
- Response: ""apexlegends,blackmyth:wukong""
- Target: ""nan""

Analysis:
- Target is ""nan"".
- Response is two specific entities: ""apexlegends,blackmyth:wukong"".
- They do not match semantically.
- Response does not approximate or point to ""nan"".
- Score: 0

- Target: ""bandainamcoentertainment""  
- Entities: ""Bandai Namco Games"" vs. ""Bandai Namco Entertainment"".  
- Are they the same entity or close enough semantically?  
Bandai Namco Entertainment was formerly known as Bandai Namco Games. They are essentially the same company entity, just a different name/version. Given the criterion allowing approximate semantics and same entity, this counts as effectively the same. Score = 1.
