### idx_0
- **Response:** ""baeksangartsawardforbestdirector–television(44th)""
- **Target:** ""2024the60thbaeksangartaward-bestactress""

**Analysis:**
- The response mentions a Baeksang Arts Award but for Best Director – Television in the 44th edition.
- The target mentions the 60th edition, year 2024, and Best Actress.
- The award categories and edition numbers differ and are not semantically equivalent.
- They do not point to the same entity.

**Score:** 0

---

### idx_1
- **Response:** ""/""
- **Target:** ""/""

**Analysis:**
- Both response and target are the same ""/"".
- This implies no information or an empty answer but they are matching.
- According to the criterion: semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.
- Here both are identical.

**Score:** 1

### idx_2
- **Response:** ""bluedragonawardsforbargain(2022)""
- **Target:** ""/""

**Analysis:**
- Response provides ""bluedragonawardsforbargain(2022)"".
- Target is ""/"".
- They differ completely.
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- No need for exact word-for-word match.

---

### idx_0  
Target: ""jangtae-yoo, choijung-in, leechang-woo"" (3 entities)  
Response: ""jangtae-yoo"" (1 entity)  

Analysis:  
- Response only gives one entity out of three. The criterion states it's sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or points to the same entity. Here, the response only matches one out of three references.  
- The response is incomplete compared to the target list. It doesn't match fully or sufficiently to be considered the same entity set or equivalent meaning.  
- Since the response is a subset, is that sufficient? The criterion says sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. The list has multiple entities, and the response only points to one of them. The reference shows three distinct names, so a partial answer is not completely correct.  
- Because the response only picks one correct entity (but the target expects more), it's not exactly equivalent.  
- Judging based on common grading practice, partial but not complete answers would get 0. However, the criterion does not say partial match is sufficient when the target includes multiple entities. The ""semantics are approximately the same"" would apply if the single name represented the same idea—like synonyms or paraphrases—but here it's just a subset.  
- Therefore, score = 0.

---

### idx_1  
Target: ""hwangkyeong-seong""  
Response: ""parkwon-guk""  

Analysis:  
- The response and target are different entities. Different names, no semantic overlap or equivalence.  
- Therefore, score = 0.

### idx_2  
Target: ""kimkyu-tae""  
Response: ""kimkyu-tae""  

Analysis:  
- Exact match, points to the same entity, semantics are clearly the same.
