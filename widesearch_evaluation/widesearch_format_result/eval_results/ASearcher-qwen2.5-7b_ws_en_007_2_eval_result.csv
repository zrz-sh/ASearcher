,,1961-05-05,1961-05-05,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair step-by-step according to the grading criteria:

- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word exact matches.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.  
Score: 1

Target: ""johnh.glenn,jr.""  
Exact match → Score: 1

**idx_2**  
Response: ""scottcarpenter""  
Target: ""malcolmscottcarpenter""  
Semantically the same person, just different form of the name. So same entity → Score: 1

---

**idx_3**

**idx_17**  
Response: ""thomasp.stafford,eugenea.cernan""  
Target: ""l.gordoncooperjr.,eugenea.cernan""  
One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I.

- The response values are either ""suborbital"" or ""orbital"".
- The target values are categories like ""humanspaceflight"", ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"", and ""uncrewedtestflight"".

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

2. idx_1: same as idx_0
   -> Score: 1

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""
   - The response is ""orbital"" which matches the target ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"" (orbital is the key word in target).
   - The response is sufficiently specific and matches the target semantics.
   -> Score: 1

4. idx_3: same as idx_2

5. idx_4: response = ""orbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""

6. idx_5: same as idx_4
   -> Score: 1

7. idx_6: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""uncrewedtestflight""
   - ""uncrewedtestflight"" refers to test flights without humans onboard.
   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.
   - Here, ""suborbital"" does not semantically match ""uncrewedtestflight"" specifically (a type of mission, not just flight type).

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""

7. idx_6: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""uncrewedtestflight""

   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.

Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I.

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.
   -> Score: 1

2. idx_1: same as idx_0
   -> Score: 1

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""
   - The response is ""orbital"" which matches the target ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"" (orbital is the key word in target).
   - The response is sufficiently specific and matches the target semantics.
   -> Score: 1

4. idx_3: same as idx_2
   -> Score: 1

5. idx_4: response = ""orbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - Orbital is a subset of humanspaceflight.
   - This matches semantically.
   -> Score: 1

6. idx_5: same as idx_4
   -> Score: 1

7. idx_6: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""uncrewedtestflight""
   - ""uncrewedtestflight"" refers to test flights without humans onboard.
   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.
   - Here, ""suborbital"" does not semantically match ""uncrewedtestflight"" specifically (a type of mission, not just flight type).
   -> Score: 0

8. idx_7: same as idx_6
   -> Score: 0

9. idx_8: response = ""orbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""

Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one.

  response = ""lc-19""  
  target = ""capecanaveral,unitedstates""  
  Here target is a location (Cape Canaveral, United States), but the response is a launch pad ""lc-19"". According to the criterion, the answer can either name the launch pad or its location, as long as the entity is the same. Since ""lc-19"" is indeed a launch pad at Cape Canaveral, these should be accepted as correct. → Score: 1 each

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""

7. idx_6: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""uncrewedtestflight""

   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target.

- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I. Grissom,"" so it likely points to the same entity. ""johnyoung"" instead of ""johnw.young"" is acceptable given semantic equivalence.

### Analysis by idx:

- **idx_0**: response = ""lc-5"", target = ""lc-5""  
  Exact match → Score: 1

- **idx_1**: response = ""lc-5"", target = ""lc-5""  
  Exact match → Score: 1

- **idx_2**: response = ""lc-14"", target = ""lc-14""  
  Exact match → Score: 1

- **idx_3**: response = ""lc-14"", target = ""lc-14""  
  Exact match → Score: 1

- **idx_4**: response = ""lc-14"", target = ""lc-14""  
  Exact match → Score: 1

- **idx_5**: response = ""lc-14"", target = ""lc-14""  
  Exact match → Score: 1

- **idx_6 to idx_10**:  
  response = ""lc-19""  
  target = ""capekennedy,lc-19""  
  Since ""lc-19"" is the launch pad that is part of Cape Kennedy, this is acceptable as per criterion (same launch pad, different naming) → Score: 1 each

- **idx_11 to idx_17**:  
  response = ""lc-19""  
  target = ""capecanaveral,unitedstates""  
  Here target is a location (Cape Canaveral, United States), but the response is a launch pad ""lc-19"". According to the criterion, the answer can either name the launch pad or its location, as long as the entity is the same. Since ""lc-19"" is indeed a launch pad at Cape Canaveral, these should be accepted as correct. → Score: 1 each

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I.

- Criterion says approximate or pointing to same entity is sufficient.
- So score: 1 for each from idx_6 to idx_12

### idx_13
- response: ""atlas-agena""
- target: ""titanii""
- ""atlas-agena"" and ""titanii"" are different names; they do not indicate the same entity.
- Names differ; no semantic equivalence indicated.
- So score: 0

### idx_14
- response: ""gemini-titanii""
- target: ""titanii""
- Same as before, semantically equivalent as ""titanii"" is contained in ""gemini-titanii""
- score: 1

### idx_15 to idx_17

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target.

- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I. Grissom,"" so it likely points to the same entity. ""johnyoung"" instead of ""johnw.young"" is acceptable given semantic equivalence.  
Score: 1

- The target values are categories like ""humanspaceflight"", ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"", and ""uncrewedtestflight"".

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.

The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I.

- ""atlas-agena"" and ""titanii"" are different names; they do not indicate the same entity.
- Names differ; no semantic equivalence indicated.
- So score: 0

### idx_14
- response: ""gemini-titanii""
- target: ""titanii""
- Same as before, semantically equivalent as ""titanii"" is contained in ""gemini-titanii""
- score: 1

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I. Grissom,"" so it likely points to the same entity. ""johnyoung"" instead of ""johnw.young"" is acceptable given semantic equivalence.  
Score: 1

- Target: ""jamesa.mcdivitt,edwardh.whiteii""  
Analysis: The response adds ""jr."" to McDivitt and has a typo ""ii"" instead of ""ii"" (number two) for Edward H. White (correct is usually II). However, such suffixes and minor formatting differences are acceptable; entities are clear and match.

- The response values are either ""suborbital"" or ""orbital"".
- The target values are categories like ""humanspaceflight"", ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"", and ""uncrewedtestflight"".

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""

   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.

- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I. Grissom,"" so it likely points to the same entity. ""johnyoung"" instead of ""johnw.young"" is acceptable given semantic equivalence.

Now, based on the pairs:

   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.

- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word exact matches.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I. Grissom,"" so it likely points to the same entity. ""johnyoung"" instead of ""johnw.young"" is acceptable given semantic equivalence.

- The response values are either ""suborbital"" or ""orbital"".
- The target values are categories like ""humanspaceflight"", ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"", and ""uncrewedtestflight"".

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""

   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.

- So score: 1 for each from idx_6 to idx_12

### idx_13
- response: ""atlas-agena""
- target: ""titanii""
- ""atlas-agena"" and ""titanii"" are different names; they do not indicate the same entity.
- Names differ; no semantic equivalence indicated.
- So score: 0

### idx_14
- response: ""gemini-titanii""
- target: ""titanii""
- Same as before, semantically equivalent as ""titanii"" is contained in ""gemini-titanii""
- score: 1

### idx_15 to idx_17

- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word exact matches.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.

One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target.

- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I.

- The response values are either ""suborbital"" or ""orbital"".
- The target values are categories like ""humanspaceflight"", ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"", and ""uncrewedtestflight"".

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""

7. idx_6: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""uncrewedtestflight""

   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).

   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.

- Exact match → score: 1

### idx_6 to idx_12:
- response: ""gemini-titanii""
- target: ""titanii""
- The response ""gemini-titanii"" includes ""titanii"", presumably the same entity or closely related composite name, likely semantically equivalent.
- Criterion says approximate or pointing to same entity is sufficient.
- So score: 1 for each from idx_6 to idx_12

### idx_13
- response: ""atlas-agena""
- target: ""titanii""
- ""atlas-agena"" and ""titanii"" are different names; they do not indicate the same entity.
- Names differ; no semantic equivalence indicated.
- So score: 0

### idx_14
- response: ""gemini-titanii""
- target: ""titanii""
- Same as before, semantically equivalent as ""titanii"" is contained in ""gemini-titanii""
- score: 1

### idx_15 to idx_17
- response: ""atlas-agena""
- target: ""titanii""
- Same as idx_13; different names, no equivalence

,,1966-07-18,1966-07-18,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step-by-step according to the grading criteria:

- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word exact matches.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""johnh.glenn,jr.""  
Target: ""johnh.glenn,jr.""  
Exact match → Score: 1

---

**idx_2**  
Response: ""scottcarpenter""  
Target: ""malcolmscottcarpenter""  
Semantically the same person, just different form of the name. So same entity → Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""walterm.schirra,jr.""  
Target: ""waltermartyschirra,jr.""  
Same person, target has full name including middle name/marty. Response uses abbreviated form but matches semantically → Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
Response: ""gordoncooper,jr.""  
Target: ""leroygordoncooper,jr.""  
Same person, just first name omitted → Score: 1

---

**idx_5**  
Response: ""charles\""pete\""conradjr.,richardf.gordonjr.""  
Target: ""alanbartlettshepard,jr.""  
Different entities entirely, no overlap, so response does not match target → Score: 0

---

**idx_6**  
Response: ""gusgrissom,johnyoung""  
Target: ""/"" (empty or no target)  
No target, so cannot verify correctness → Score: 0 by default

**idx_17**  
Response: ""thomasp.stafford,eugenea.cernan""  
Target: ""l.gordoncooperjr.,eugenea.cernan""  
One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

**idx_8**  
- Response: ""gusgrissom,johnyoung""  
- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I. Grissom,"" so it likely points to the same entity. ""johnyoung"" instead of ""johnw.young"" is acceptable given semantic equivalence.  
Score: 1

- Target: ""jamesa.mcdivitt,edwardh.whiteii""  
Analysis: The response adds ""jr."" to McDivitt and has a typo ""ii"" instead of ""ii"" (number two) for Edward H. White (correct is usually II). However, such suffixes and minor formatting differences are acceptable; entities are clear and match.

  Here target is a location (Cape Canaveral, United States), but the response is a launch pad ""lc-19"". According to the criterion, the answer can either name the launch pad or its location, as long as the entity is the same. Since ""lc-19"" is indeed a launch pad at Cape Canaveral, these should be accepted as correct. → Score: 1 each

- The response values are either ""suborbital"" or ""orbital"".
- The target values are categories like ""humanspaceflight"", ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"", and ""uncrewedtestflight"".

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""

   - The response is sufficiently specific and matches the target semantics.

4. idx_3: same as idx_2

7. idx_6: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""uncrewedtestflight""
   - ""uncrewedtestflight"" refers to test flights without humans onboard.
   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.
   - Here, ""suborbital"" does not semantically match ""uncrewedtestflight"" specifically (a type of mission, not just flight type).

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).

   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.

,,1966-11-11,1966-11-11,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step-by-step according to the grading criteria:

- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word exact matches.

---

**idx_0**  
Response: ""virgili.grissom,johnh.glenn""  
Target: ""johnherschelglenn,jr.""  
Analysis: Response includes ""virgili.grissom"" which is not in target, and ""johnh.glenn"" (likely the same person as ""johnherschelglenn,jr."" although without Jr.). The target only lists one entity, whereas the response lists two. The response does include the target entity (John Glenn) but also an extra one. Since the response includes the target entity (John Glenn junior) with slightly different name formatting, this is semantically the same for scoring purposes.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""johnh.glenn,jr.""  
Target: ""johnh.glenn,jr.""  
Exact match → Score: 1

---

**idx_2**  
Response: ""scottcarpenter""  
Target: ""malcolmscottcarpenter""  
Semantically the same person, just different form of the name. So same entity → Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""walterm.schirra,jr.""  
Target: ""waltermartyschirra,jr.""  
Same person, target has full name including middle name/marty. Response uses abbreviated form but matches semantically → Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
Response: ""gordoncooper,jr.""  
Target: ""leroygordoncooper,jr.""  
Same person, just first name omitted → Score: 1

---

**idx_5**  
Response: ""charles\""pete\""conradjr.,richardf.gordonjr.""  
Target: ""alanbartlettshepard,jr.""  
Different entities entirely, no overlap, so response does not match target → Score: 0

Target: ""/"" (empty or no target)  
No target, so cannot verify correctness → Score: 0 by default

**idx_17**  
Response: ""thomasp.stafford,eugenea.cernan""  
Target: ""l.gordoncooperjr.,eugenea.cernan""  
One person matches (eugenea.cernan), the other does not → partial correctness? But since scoring only 0 or 1, and the response must approximately match the same entities as target. Here half is correct but the other half is not. Judging based on criterion, we require approximately the same entities. One mismatch means score 0 → Score: 0

**idx_8**  
- Response: ""gusgrissom,johnyoung""  
- Target: ""johnw.young,virgili.grissom""  
Analysis: Names swapped in order (which is acceptable), but response has ""gusgrissom"" instead of ""virgili.grissom"" (typo or nickname). The last names align (Grissom and Young), but first name ""gus"" instead of ""virgili"" is problematic. ""Gus Grissom"" is a known nickname for ""Virgil I. Grissom,"" so it likely points to the same entity. ""johnyoung"" instead of ""johnw.young"" is acceptable given semantic equivalence.  
Score: 1

- Target: ""jamesa.mcdivitt,edwardh.whiteii""  
Analysis: The response adds ""jr."" to McDivitt and has a typo ""ii"" instead of ""ii"" (number two) for Edward H. White (correct is usually II). However, such suffixes and minor formatting differences are acceptable; entities are clear and match.

```",success,success,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair of response and target one by one:

- The response values are either ""suborbital"" or ""orbital"".
- The target values are categories like ""humanspaceflight"", ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"", and ""uncrewedtestflight"".

Given the criterion: it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. It also states that different reference sources can be accepted for the same mission or concept.

Now, based on the pairs:

1. idx_0: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - ""humanspaceflight"" can include both suborbital and orbital flights.
   - But ""suborbital"" is a type of humanspaceflight (e.g., flights that cross the boundary of space but don't orbit).
   - So the response is appropriate and semantically matches the target category.
   -> Score: 1

2. idx_1: same as idx_0
   -> Score: 1

3. idx_2: response = ""orbital"", target = ""crewedorbitalspaceflight""
   - The response is ""orbital"" which matches the target ""crewedorbitalspaceflight"" (orbital is the key word in target).
   - The response is sufficiently specific and matches the target semantics.
   -> Score: 1

4. idx_3: same as idx_2
   -> Score: 1

5. idx_4: response = ""orbital"", target = ""humanspaceflight""
   - Orbital is a subset of humanspaceflight.
   - This matches semantically.
   -> Score: 1

6. idx_5: same as idx_4
   -> Score: 1

7. idx_6: response = ""suborbital"", target = ""uncrewedtestflight""
   - ""uncrewedtestflight"" refers to test flights without humans onboard.
   - ""suborbital"" is a flight type but does not necessarily indicate if it is crewed or uncrewed, test or operational.
   - The response does not directly point to uncrewed test flight.
   - According to the criterion, the response must approximate the reference meaning or point to the same entity.
   - Here, ""suborbital"" does not semantically match ""uncrewedtestflight"" specifically (a type of mission, not just flight type).

8. idx_7: same as idx_6

### idx_6 to idx_12:
- response: ""gemini-titanii""
- target: ""titanii""
- The response ""gemini-titanii"" includes ""titanii"", presumably the same entity or closely related composite name, likely semantically equivalent.
- Criterion says approximate or pointing to same entity is sufficient.
- So score: 1 for each from idx_6 to idx_12

### idx_13
- response: ""atlas-agena""
- target: ""titanii""
- ""atlas-agena"" and ""titanii"" are different names; they do not indicate the same entity.
- Names differ; no semantic equivalence indicated.
- So score: 0

### idx_14
- response: ""gemini-titanii""
- target: ""titanii""
- Same as before, semantically equivalent as ""titanii"" is contained in ""gemini-titanii""
- score: 1

### idx_15 to idx_17
- response: ""atlas-agena""
- target: ""titanii""
- Same as idx_13; different names, no equivalence
