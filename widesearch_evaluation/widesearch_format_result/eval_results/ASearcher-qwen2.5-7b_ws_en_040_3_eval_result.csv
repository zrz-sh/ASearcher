- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""

- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_14**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_15**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Video content vs social media platform category. Not the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_16**: response = ""reading"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_17**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_18**: response = ""dating"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_19**: response = ""music"", target = ""music""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_20**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_21**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

**idx_24**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different entities.

**idx_25**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_14**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_15**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Video content vs social media platform category. Not the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_16**: response = ""reading"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_17**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_18**: response = ""dating"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_19**: response = ""music"", target = ""music""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_20**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_21**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

**idx_24**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different entities.  
- Score: 0

**idx_25**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no.

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_14**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_15**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Video content vs social media platform category. Not the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_16**: response = ""reading"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_17**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_18**: response = ""dating"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_19**: response = ""music"", target = ""music""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_20**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_21**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

**idx_24**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different entities.  
- Score: 0

**idx_25**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no.

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""

- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_14**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_15**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Video content vs social media platform category. Not the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_16**: response = ""reading"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_17**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.

**idx_18**: response = ""dating"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_19**: response = ""music"", target = ""music""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_20**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_21**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

**idx_24**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different entities.

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_14**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_15**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Video content vs social media platform category. Not the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_16**: response = ""reading"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_17**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_18**: response = ""dating"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_19**: response = ""music"", target = ""music""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_20**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_21**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

**idx_24**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different entities.  
- Score: 0

**idx_25**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no.

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_14**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_15**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Video content vs social media platform category. Not the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_16**: response = ""reading"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_17**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_18**: response = ""dating"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_19**: response = ""music"", target = ""music""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_20**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_21**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

**idx_24**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different entities.  
- Score: 0

**idx_25**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no.

Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""

- Criterion recap: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-by-word match.

---

**idx_0**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""social"" can be taken as shorthand for ""social media"" (common). Same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as idx_0, equivalent.  
- Score: 1

**idx_3**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- ""video"" vs. ""socialmedia"", not the same entity or semantic equivalence. Video is a content type, social media is a platform type. No equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_4**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""communication""  
- ""gaming"" vs. ""communication"" not equivalent. Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_5**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response = ""reading"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Reading is an activity, social media is platform category. Not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_7**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_8**: response = ""dating"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts, not equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_9**: response = ""music"", target = ""entertainment""  
- ""music"" is a subcategory of ""entertainment"", semantically included. The criterion says ""approximately the same or pointing to the same entity"" – here ""music"" is narrower than ""entertainment"" but still under entertainment. Does this count? Usually, the response is more specific. The criterion does not clarify if sub-category is accepted, but ""points to the same entity"" is required. ""Music"" is a type of entertainment, ""entertainment"" includes more than music.  
- Since the response is a subset of the target, intuitively acceptable as semantically related enough to be counted as same entity concept.  
- Score: 1

**idx_10**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Same as earlier, accepted.  
- Score: 1

**idx_11**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Messaging is a type of feature within social media but not synonymous to social media. The response points to messaging, target is social media; different entities. So no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_13**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_14**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no equivalence.  
- Score: 0

**idx_15**: response = ""video"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Video content vs social media platform category. Not the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_16**: response = ""reading"", target = ""communication""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_17**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""messaging""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_18**: response = ""dating"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Different concepts.  
- Score: 0

**idx_19**: response = ""music"", target = ""music""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_20**: response = ""social"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Accepted as before.  
- Score: 1

**idx_21**: response = ""messaging"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_22**: response = ""social"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different entities, no.  
- Score: 0

**idx_23**: response = ""video"", target = ""photo&video""  
- Video is a main part of photo&video. One is subset of the other, so semantically pointing to the same entity is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

**idx_24**: response = ""gaming"", target = ""socialmedia""  
- Different entities.  
- Score: 0

**idx_25**: response = ""video"", target = ""messaging""  
- Different, no.
