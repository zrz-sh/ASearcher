apexlegends™,Apex Legends,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze the provided data step by step.

- There is only one pair to grade, idx_0.
- The response is: ""hades,doometernal,half-life:alyx,nioh2,streetsofrage4""
- The standard answer (target) is: ""nan"" (which likely means no valid target answer is provided or ""not a number"", maybe unspecified).
- Grading criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word matching.

Step 1: Check if the response's semantics approximately match the standard answer.

- The standard answer is 'nan', which can mean no answer or no target.

Given that the standard answer is ""nan"", it is ambiguous what the correct answer is.

Possible interpretations:

- The ""nan"" here might indicate that no valid answer is known or provided.
- The response provides a list of game titles, presumably answers to a question about games.

Since the standard answer is ""nan"", this likely means there is no reference answer or that the question is invalid or missing.

Hence:

- The response provides some data, while the target is 'nan'.

- Since there is no reference answer, it is impossible to judge whether the response is correct or not.

But the instructions say to score from 0 to 1, where 1 means completely correct.

Since no info about the standard answer is provided, we cannot confirm correctness.

Therefore, the safest is to score 0 because the response does not match any known target or semantic equivalent.

Alternatively, maybe ""nan"" means the question was invalid or empty, and therefore the response is irrelevant.

Therefore, the score is 0.

**Final scoring:**

  ""idx_0"": 0

```",nan,"hades,doometernal,half-life:alyx,nioh2,streetsofrage4",1.0,"Let's analyze the response against the target according to the criterion:

- Criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- The target is ""electronicarts""
- The response is ""electronicarts""
- The response exactly matches the target.

Thus, the response is fully correct and should get a score of 1.
