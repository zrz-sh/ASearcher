  Let's break down the target: ""larépubliqueenmarche!"" is the French political party ""La République En Marche!"" associated with Emmanuel Macron. The response ""macron'slrem"" is trying to state ""Macron's LREM,"" LREM being the acronym of La République En Marche. Semantically, they refer to the same entity — the party founded or attributed to Macron. The difference is in spelling and presentation, but the criterion allows approximate same semantics pointing to the same entity, with no need for word-for-word correspondence.  
  Therefore, this is acceptable.
