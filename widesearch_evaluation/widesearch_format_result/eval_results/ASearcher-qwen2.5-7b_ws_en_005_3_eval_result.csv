### idx_0

The response ""3.0 or higher"" could be interpreted as 3.0 on 4.0 scale or otherwise, but target specifies 5/7 (~3.57/4).

### idx_0  
- **Response:** ""3.8orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""gpa≥2.5/4.0""  
- Analysis: The response indicates a GPA threshold of 3.8 or higher, while the target sets the minimum GPA at 2.5/4.0. These are different thresholds. The response is not consistent with the standard answer.  
- Score: 0  

### idx_1  
- **Response:** ""3.8orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Analysis: The target indicates no minimum GPA, but the response provides a specific minimum GPA (3.8 or higher). Thus, semantics differ.

- Same as above, score: 0  

### idx_5  
- **Response:** ""3.0orhigher""

- Analysis: The response gives 3.0+, target gives 5.0/7.0. To compare, convert 3.0/4.0 scale to 7.0 scale or vice versa, but no explicit scale is provided for response. The response ""3.0 or higher"" could be interpreted as 3.0 on 4.0 scale or otherwise, but target specifies 5/7 (~3.57/4). Given no indication of scale in response, and values differ substantially, these do not match.  
- Score: 0  

### idx_6  
- **Response:** ""3.0orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""wam≥65%""  
- Analysis: WAM (Weighted Average Mark) ≥ 65% is a percentage. Response specifies ""3.0 or higher"" (likely GPA?). Different metrics, not approximately the same.

### idx_11  
- Same as idx_6, score: 0  

### idx_12  
- **Response:** ""3.0orhigher""

---

### idx_0  
- **Response:** ""3.8orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""gpa≥2.5/4.0""  
- Analysis: The response indicates a GPA threshold of 3.8 or higher, while the target sets the minimum GPA at 2.5/4.0. These are different thresholds. The response is not consistent with the standard answer.  
- Score: 0  

### idx_1  
- **Response:** ""3.8orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Analysis: The target indicates no minimum GPA, but the response provides a specific minimum GPA (3.8 or higher). Thus, semantics differ.  
- Score: 0  

### idx_2  
- **Response:** ""3.8orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Same as idx_1, score: 0  

### idx_3  
- Same as idx_1 and idx_2, score: 0  

### idx_4  
- Same as above, score: 0  

### idx_5  
- **Response:** ""3.0orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""gpa≥5.0/7.0""  
- Analysis: The response gives 3.0+, target gives 5.0/7.0. To compare, convert 3.0/4.0 scale to 7.0 scale or vice versa, but no explicit scale is provided for response. The response ""3.0 or higher"" could be interpreted as 3.0 on 4.0 scale or otherwise, but target specifies 5/7 (~3.57/4). Given no indication of scale in response, and values differ substantially, these do not match.  
- Score: 0  

### idx_6  
- **Response:** ""3.0orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""wam≥65%""  
- Analysis: WAM (Weighted Average Mark) ≥ 65% is a percentage. Response specifies ""3.0 or higher"" (likely GPA?). Different metrics, not approximately the same.  
- Score: 0  

### idx_7  
- Same as idx_6, score: 0  

### idx_8  
- Same as idx_6, score: 0  

### idx_9  
- Same as idx_5, score: 0  

### idx_10  
- **Response:** ""3.0orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""credit average≥65%""  
- Analysis: Response shows GPA scale, target gives credit average percentage. Different forms, do not match.  
- Score: 0  

### idx_11  
- Same as idx_6, score: 0  

### idx_12  
- **Response:** ""3.0orhigher""  
- **Target:** ""gpa≥4.5/7.0""  
- Analysis: Response is 3.0 or higher, target is 4.5 on 7.0 scale. Unless response means 3.0 on 7.0 scale (which is less than 4.5), not matching. Different thresholds.  
- Score: 0

### Summary:  
No response semantically matches the target answer or points to the same entity within these pairs.
