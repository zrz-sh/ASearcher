The difference in postal code might be a minor error or a parsing difference, but since the street number and name match, and given the criterion about approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity, this is borderline.

Is the postal code significant? Postal codes in Paris define the arrondissement and are important for locations — 75001 is the 1st arrondissement where Quai du Louvre is located, 75004 is 4th arrondissement. The postal code difference suggests the address is slightly off geographically, but the street address matches exactly.

Analysis:  
The target describes a vegetable-forward, garden-inspired French cuisine, which is centered around vegetables but still French cuisine. The response ""vegetarian"" is related but more general and not explicitly stating the cuisine style or French influence. However, since ""vegetable-forward"" implies a focus on vegetables, and ""vegetarian"" indicates a diet excluding meat, these are close in content.
