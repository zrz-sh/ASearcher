### Pair idx_0
- **Response:** ""9-12""
- **Target:** ""grades9-12""
- **Analysis:** The response ""9-12"" clearly corresponds to ""grades9-12"". The semantics are the same (grade levels 9 to 12). The omission of ""grades"" is acceptable since the quantities are identical and clearly refer to ""grades 9 to 12"".
- **Score:** 1

---

### Pair idx_1
- **Response:** ""9-12""
- **Target:** ""grades5-12""
- **Analysis:** The response indicates grade levels 9-12, but the target references grades 5-12. The semantics differ since the response excludes grades 5-8. The criterion requires either approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity. Here the ranges don’t match, so it is semantically different.
