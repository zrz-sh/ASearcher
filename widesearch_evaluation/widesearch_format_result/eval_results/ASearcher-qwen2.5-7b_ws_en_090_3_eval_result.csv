**idx_0**  
- Response: ""1,048,576""  
- Target: ""1m"" (1 million, typically 1,000,000)

Analysis:  
- The response value ""1,048,576"" corresponds to 2^20, often called 1 megabyte in bytes, but numerically it is 1,048,576.  
- The target ""1m"" likely stands for 1 million or 1,000,000.  
- Semantically, 1,048,576 is roughly close to 1 million, often considered 1m in binary form contexts. The criterion says approximate semantics are sufficient.  
- Here, the difference is about 4.8%, and in digital memory contexts 1m can mean 2^20. So by the criterion, this should be accepted.
