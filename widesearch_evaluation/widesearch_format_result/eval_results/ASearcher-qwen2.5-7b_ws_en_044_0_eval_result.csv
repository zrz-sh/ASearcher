,,nationalmuseumofmodernandcontemporaryart(nmca),National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair step-by-step according to the criterion:

Criterion:  
- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity is sufficient.  
- No need for exact word-for-word correspondence.

---

### idx_0

- Response: ""30,samcheong-ro,jongno-gu,seoul03062""  
- Target: ""30samcheong-ro,jongnodistrict,seoul""

Analysis:  
- Number: ""30"" vs ""30"" — same.  
- Street: ""samcheong-ro"" vs ""samcheong-ro"" — same.  
- District: ""jongno-gu"" vs ""jongnodistrict"" — ""gu"" and ""district"" refer to the same administrative division, just different wording. So semantics are approximately the same.  
- City: ""seoul03062"" vs ""seoul"" — ""seoul"" part matches. Additional number likely a postal code, not necessary.  
Overall, the response conveys the same entity as the target, despite minor formatting and wording differences.

Score: 1

---

### idx_1

- Response: ""807,seolleung-ro,gangnam-gu,seoul06019""  
- Target: ""807seolleung-ro,gangnamdistrict,seoul""

Analysis:  
- Number: ""807"" vs ""807"" — same.  
- Street: ""seolleung-ro"" vs ""seolleung-ro"" — same.  
- District: ""gangnam-gu"" vs ""gangnamdistrict"" — again, ""gu"" and ""district"" are equivalent, so semantics match.  
- City: ""seoul06019"" vs ""seoul"" — city matches; number probably postal code, which is extra but not penalized.  
Semantics are consistent and refer to the same entity.

**Item idx_0:**  
- Response: ""free""  
- Target: ""charged""  
Analysis:  
""free"" and ""charged"" are semantically opposite concepts in this context (likely about some quantity or property). They do not approximate the same meaning nor do they point to the same entity.  
Score: 0

**Item idx_1:**

- **Response:** ""monday–tuesday,thursday–fridayandsunday10am–6pm,wednesdayandsaturday10am–9pm""

  - Wednesday and Saturday: 10am – 9pm (which corresponds to 10:00 to 21:00)
  
The response might be a bit compressed but conveys the same schedule as the target: the same days and corresponding opening hours.

- **Criterion:** ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. Closure dates not necessary.""

Since the semantics are matching, this should be scored as correct (1).
