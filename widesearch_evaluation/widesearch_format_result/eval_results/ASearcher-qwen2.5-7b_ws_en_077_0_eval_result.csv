**idx_1**  
- Response: ""jimmattis(acting)""  
- Target: ""markesper""  
Analysis: These are different persons (""Jim Mattis"" vs ""Mark Esper""). Different entities, so no match.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""markmodal""  
- Target: ""-""  
Analysis: Target is ""-"", which presumably means no correct answer or N/A. There's no target to compare with, so no way to verify correctness. Generally, when target is ""-"", response should be scored 0 unless otherwise indicated. Here it seems to be the case.  
Score: 0

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""mikepompeo""  
- Target: ""mikepompeo""  
Analysis: Exact match, obviously same entity.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""secretariat""  
- Target: ""-""  
Analysis: Target is ""-"", no reference answer. Response ""secretariat"" is a different type of entity (a position or institution rather than a person). No target to check against, so score 0.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_5**  
- Response: ""williambarr""  
- Target: ""williambaar""  
Analysis: Names differ only in a minor typo: ""barr"" vs ""baar."" Obviously intended to refer to William Barr. Same entity.  
Score: 1
