```",tiktok,tiktok,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

```",instagram,disney+,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

idx_29: response='messaging', target='music'  
Messaging ≠ music. Score=0

```",zoom,tencentvideo,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

```",googlemeet,whatsapp,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

```",netflix,facebook,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

```",facebook,snapchat,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

```",whatsapp,whatsapp,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

```",zoom,wechat,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

```",messenger,youtube,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

```",instagram,whatsapp,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

```",whatsapp,messenger,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

```",telegram,youtube,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

```",subwaysurfers,wechat,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
- gaming ≈ social - games vs social - different concepts; likely no.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

idx_22: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_23: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Same as idx_18. Score=1

idx_24: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_25: response='video', target='messaging'  
Same as idx_17. Video and messaging different. Score=0

idx_26: response='messaging', target='games'  
Messaging ≠ games. Score=0

idx_27: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_28: response='social', target='games'  
Social ≠ games. Score=0

Messaging ≠ music. Score=0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- social ≈ socialmedia - acceptable (as social relates to social media).
- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.

Now check item by item:

---

idx_0: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Social and social media are close; social implies social media. Score = 1

idx_1: response='dating', target='messaging'  
Dating vs messaging - different categories. Score = 0

idx_2: response='video', target='socialmedia'  
Video content is often part of social media; acceptable by criterion. Score = 1

idx_3: response='streaming', target='socialmedia'  
Streaming can be part of social media. Score = 1

idx_4: response='streaming', target='communication'  
Streaming != communication, streaming is content delivery, communication is interaction. Different. Score = 0

idx_5: response='manga', target='messaging'  
Manga (comic) != messaging. Score = 0

idx_6: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Messaging apps can be part of social media but messaging is different from all social media (e.g., Facebook). More communication oriented. However, messaging is on communication side, so this might be marginal but since social media includes messaging apps (like Facebook messenger), this could be acceptable.  
Given criterion allows semantics approximately same or points to the same entity, messaging is part of communication more than social media. Possibly borderline but safer to say no. Score=0

idx_7: response='social', target='messaging'  
Social vs messaging - different. Score=0

idx_8: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Messaging is type of communication. Score=1

idx_9: response='social', target='entertainment'  
Social and entertainment overlap often (e.g., Facebook is social media and also entertaining), but differ in core meaning.  
Code says approximate or pointing to the same entity is enough. Since entertainment is broader and social is also social media which provides entertainment, this might be acceptable. Score=1

idx_10: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_11: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_12: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same. Score=1

idx_13: response='messaging', target='messaging'  
Identical. Score=1

idx_14: response='social', target='messaging'  
Different. Score=0

idx_15: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, reasoning applies. Score=0

idx_16: response='messaging', target='communication'  
Same as idx_8. Score=1

idx_17: response='video', target='messaging'  
Video ≠ messaging. Score=0

idx_18: response='social', target='photo&video'  
Social vs photo & video: social often overlaps with photo & video (Instagram etc).  
Criterion is lenient if approximate or same entity. Social media often means photo/video sharing.  
Score=1

idx_19: response='video', target='music'  
Video and music are related but different. Video ≠ music. Score=0

idx_20: response='social', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_0. Score=1

idx_21: response='messaging', target='socialmedia'  
Same as idx_6, idx_15. Score=0

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

This basically means synonyms or close semantic categories are accepted. For instance:

- messaging ≈ communication - acceptable.
- streaming ≈ socialmedia - probably yes, because streaming can be part of social media (like live streaming on social media).
- manga ≈ messaging - no, these are quite unrelated.
- dating ≈ messaging - no, dating and messaging are different app categories.
- video ≈ socialmedia - video content can be social media or part of it (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). So probably acceptable.
- video ≈ music - possibly no, music and video are distinct even if related.
- social ≈ entertainment - social may overlap with entertainment but from the criterion, the entities should be approximately same or point to the same entity, this is likely acceptable.
