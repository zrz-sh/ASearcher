Criterion summary:  
- The semantics of the response and the target must be approximately the same or refer to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word correspondence is not necessary.  
- Here the response is 'nan' for all items, which clearly does not correspond to or point to the entity in the target.

Item by item analysis:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'tomleatherman'  
  'nan' means no valid or relevant answer; it does not point to 'tomleatherman' or anything similar. Score = 0

- idx_1: response = 'nan', target = 'davidsmith'  
  Same reasoning: response does not point to target. Score = 0

- idx_2: response = 'nan', target = 'michellewheatley'  
  Same, response irrelevant to target. Score = 0

- idx_3: response = 'nan', target = 'lenapace'  
  Same, no match. Score = 0

- idx_4: response = 'nan', target = 'gerardogonzalez'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_5: response = 'nan', target = 'jeffbradybaugh'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_6: response = 'nan', target = 'cameron(cam)sholly'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_7: response = 'nan', target = 'kevinschneider'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_8: response = 'nan', target = 'kevinheatley'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_9: response = 'nan', target = 'nataliegates'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_10: response = 'nan', target = 'cassiuscash'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_11: response = 'nan', target = 'leonelarguello'  
  No match. Score = 0

- idx_12: response = 'nan', target = 'lenapace'  
  No match. Score = 0

All responses are 'nan' which cannot be accepted as matching any target.

Final scoring results: all 0.
