johnniewalker,Johnnie Walker,,,redlabel,Red Label,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criteria:

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics should be approximately the same or refer to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word or format match.  
- Score is either 0 or 1.

---

**Item idx_0:**  
- Response: ""40""  
- Target: ""40.0%""  
Analysis: The response mentions ""40"" which is the numeric value of the percentage without the decimal or % sign. The semantic meaning (40 out of 100) is clear and corresponds to 40%. The criterion states approximate semantic match is sufficient. Hence, this response matches the target in meaning.  
Score: 1

**Item idx_1:**  
- Response: ""40""  
- Target: ""40.0%""  
Analysis: Same as idx_0, it's semantically consistent.

**idx_0**

- Target: ""whisky""  
Analysis: ""vodka"" and ""whisky"" are two different types of alcoholic beverages. They do not refer to the same entity or have approximately the same semantics. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, no need for exact word match.  
- Volume difference is acceptable because different regions have wines of different specifications, so exact capacity match is not required.

Pairs to grade:  
- idx_0: response ""700ml"" vs target ""750ml""  
- idx_1: same as idx_0  
- idx_2: same as idx_0 

Analysis:  
- All three responses give ""700ml"" while the target is ""750ml"".  
- These are both typical wine bottle sizes and indicate the same kind of information (wine bottle volume).  
- The criterion explicitly allows for capacity differences due to regional specification differences. So a response of 700ml is acceptable as approximately the same.  
- Hence all responses should be scored 1.
