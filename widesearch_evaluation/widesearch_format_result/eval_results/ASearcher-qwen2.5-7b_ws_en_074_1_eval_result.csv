Criterion:  
- Semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""marinelepen""  
- Target: ""marinelepen""  
Analysis: The response exactly matches the target. So, this is a full correct answer.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""fraukepetry""  
- Target: ""alexandergauland&\naliceweidel""  
Analysis:  
- The target expects two entities ""alexandergauland"" and ""aliceweidel"" (note the ""&"" indicating two persons).  
- The response only gives ""fraukepetry,"" which is a different person, so it does not point to the expected entities.  
- Therefore, the semantics are not the same or approximately the same, nor does it point to the same entities.  
Score: 0
