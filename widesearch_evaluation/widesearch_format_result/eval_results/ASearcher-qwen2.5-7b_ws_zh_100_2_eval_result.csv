Criterion: The response and the target are considered correct if they are semantically largely the same or point to the same entities; exact word-by-word matching is not required.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""256gb/512gb""  
- Target: ""256gb、512gb、1tb""  
- Analysis: The response includes ""256gb"" and ""512gb"", both present in the target. The target also includes ""1tb"", which is missing in the response. However, the criterion does not require a complete list if the response captures part of the target's entities that are significant and semantically consistent. Since ""256gb"" and ""512gb"" are indeed a subset of the target options and mention the same entities, it should get full credit (1).

Since ""512gb"" and ""512g"" indicate the same entity (""512 gigabytes""), this is semantically consistent. ""256gb"" is also present in both.
