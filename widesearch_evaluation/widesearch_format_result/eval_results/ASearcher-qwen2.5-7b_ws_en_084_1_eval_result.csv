,,2010/2/12,2010-02-12,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step according to the grading criterion:

Criterion states: 
- The responses are considered correct if their semantics are approximately the same as the reference answers or they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word match, but answers should be essentially equivalent.

### idx_0:
- Response: ""23""

These are two different numbers, and no semantic equivalence or similarity between ""23"" and ""44"". They point to different entities/numbers.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""andrewwurst""  
- Target: ""femaleschoolteacher""  
Analysis:  
The target is an entity described as a ""female school teacher,"" which indicates a profession and gender. The response is a proper name ""andrewwurst,"" which is presumably a male name (Andrew) and is not semantically equivalent to ""female school teacher."" There is no indication that ""andrewwurst"" means or points to a female school teacher. So semantics do not match.

Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""nikolascruz""  
- Target: ""formerstudent(expelled)""  
Analysis:  
The target is ""former student (expelled)""—a person with a specific status.  
""nikolascruz"" is a proper name of a real person known famously as a former student who got expelled (from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School).  

The criterion allows for non-exact matching as long as semantics correspond or refer to the same entity. Since ""nikolascruz"" matches exactly the ""formerstudent(expelled)"" in terms of identity it points to, this is correct.

Score: 1

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""timothyp.pisciotta""  
- Target: ""schoolstudent""  
Analysis:  
The target is ""schoolstudent,"" a general role. The response is the name ""timothyp.pisciotta,"" presumably a person known to be a school student.  

Again, per the criterion, semantics only need to approximately match or point to the same entity. If ""timothyp.pisciotta"" is known to be a ""schoolstudent,"" this response is acceptable.
