Criterion Summary:  
- The response only needs to approximately match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target.  
- Matching one or more names/entities is enough for a score of 1.  
- Irrelevant extra entities in the response don't cause deduction if there's at least one match.  
- No match means score 0.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Main body consistency is sufficient, even if featuring artists or ""feat."" parts are missing or different.

### Analysis:

- idx_0: response = ""asitwas"" vs target = ""espresso""  
  These are different song titles, not semantically identical or pointing to the same entity.  
  Score = 0

- idx_1: response = ""good4u"" vs target = ""notlikeus""  
  Different titles, no semantical or entity match.  
  Score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""industrybaby"" vs target = ""abarsong(tipsy)""  
  Different titles, no match.  
  Score = 0

- idx_3: response = ""montero(callmeby"" vs target = ""ihadsomehelp(feat.morganwallen)""  
  Different titles. Although both show possible features or parenthetical info, main titles differ. Not the same entity.  
  Score = 0

- idx_4: response = ""swervin'"" vs target = ""milliondollarbaby""  
  Different titles, no match.  
  Score = 0

- idx_5: response = ""peaches"" vs target = ""goodluck,babe!""
