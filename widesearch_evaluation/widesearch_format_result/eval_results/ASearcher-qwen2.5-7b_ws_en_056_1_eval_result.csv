The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams

- **idx_14:**  
  Target: adamlevine, kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson, blakeshelton, kelseaballerini(comebackstage)  
  Response lacks kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson. Also the comeback stage person can be ignored.  
  But response still misses kelly and jennifer → Score: 0

- **idx_15:**  
  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

  Guest ignored, but response misses all except blakeshelton → Score: 0

- **idx_20:**

  Guests/comeback ignored, still response misses very many → Score: 0

- **idx_24:**

  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_25:**  
  Target: michaelbublé, gwenstefani, rebamcentire, snoopdogg

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

```",carsondaly,carsondaly,1.0,"Analysis:

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams

  Response lacks kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson. Also the comeback stage person can be ignored.  
  But response still misses kelly and jennifer → Score: 0

- **idx_15:**  
  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

- **idx_25:**  
  Target: michaelbublé, gwenstefani, rebamcentire, snoopdogg

### Summary:

Only responses exactly matching the target or roughly pointing to the same artists in the standard target receive 1. Others receive 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

```",carsondaly,carsondaly,0.0,"Analysis:

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams

  Response lacks kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson. Also the comeback stage person can be ignored.  
  But response still misses kelly and jennifer → Score: 0

- **idx_15:**  
  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.

- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams

  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

### Summary:

Only responses exactly matching the target or roughly pointing to the same artists in the standard target receive 1. Others receive 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

---

**Criterion:**

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.

### Breakdown by idx:

- **idx_0:**  
  Target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Perfect match → Score: 1

- **idx_1:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

- **idx_2:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

- **idx_3:**  
  Target: adamlevine, shakira, usher, blakeshelton  
  Response replaced shakira and usher with ceelogreen and christinaaguilera. Different people.  
  Not the same semantics/entities → Score: 0

- **idx_6:**  
  Target: adamlevine, gwenstefani, pharrellwilliams, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen, christinaaguilera not in target, and misses gwen, pharrell. Not same entities → Score: 0

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams  
  No word-for-word needed, but ceelo and pharrell are different artists → Score: 0

- **idx_8:**  
  Target: adamlevine, gwenstefani, pharrellwilliams, blakeshelton  
  Same as idx_6 → Score: 0

- **idx_9:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton

  Response has ceelogreen, christinaaguilera instead of mileycyrus, aliciakeys. Different artists → Score: 0

- **idx_11:**  
  Target: adamlevine, gwenstefani, aliciakeys, blakeshelton  
  Response differs (ceelogreen, christinaaguilera) vs (gwenstefani, aliciakeys) → Score: 0

- **idx_12:**

  Response differs → Score: 0

- **idx_13:**  
  Target: adamlevine, aliciakeys, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton  
  Response differs → Score: 0

- **idx_14:**  
  Target: adamlevine, kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson, blakeshelton, kelseaballerini(comebackstage)  
  Response lacks kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson. Also the comeback stage person can be ignored.  
  But response still misses kelly and jennifer → Score: 0

- **idx_15:**  
  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**  
  Target: kellyclarkson, gwenstefani, johnlegend, blakeshelton  
  Response misses all except blakeshelton → Score: 0

- **idx_17:**  
  Target: kellyclarkson, nickjonas, johnlegend, blakeshelton  
  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_18:**

  Guest ignored, but response misses all except blakeshelton → Score: 0

- **idx_20:**

  Response misses all except blakeshelton → Score: 0

- **idx_21:**  
  Target: johnlegend, gwenstefani, camilacabello, blakeshelton  
  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_22:**  
  Target: kellyclarkson, chancetherapper, niallhoran, blakeshelton  
  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_23:**  
  Target: johnlegend, gwenstefani, niallhoran, rebamcentire, dan+shay(guest)  
  Guests/comeback ignored, still response misses very many → Score: 0

- **idx_24:**  
  Target: johnlegend, dan+shay, chancetherapper, rebamcentire  
  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_25:**  
  Target: michaelbublé, gwenstefani, rebamcentire, snoopdogg  
  Response misses → Score: 0

### Summary:

Only responses exactly matching the target or roughly pointing to the same artists in the standard target receive 1. Others receive 0.

  Perfect match → Score: 1

- **idx_1:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams

- **idx_15:**  
  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

  Guests/comeback ignored, still response misses very many → Score: 0

- **idx_24:**

- **idx_25:**  
  Target: michaelbublé, gwenstefani, rebamcentire, snoopdogg

### Summary:

Only responses exactly matching the target or roughly pointing to the same artists in the standard target receive 1. Others receive 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

```",carsondaly,carsondaly,0.0,"Analysis:

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

### Breakdown by idx:

- **idx_0:**  
  Target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Perfect match → Score: 1

- **idx_1:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

  Response contains ceelogreen, christinaaguilera not in target, and misses gwen, pharrell. Not same entities → Score: 0

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams  
  No word-for-word needed, but ceelo and pharrell are different artists → Score: 0

- **idx_8:**

- **idx_14:**  
  Target: adamlevine, kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson, blakeshelton, kelseaballerini(comebackstage)  
  Response lacks kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson. Also the comeback stage person can be ignored.  
  But response still misses kelly and jennifer → Score: 0

- **idx_15:**  
  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

  Guests/comeback ignored, still response misses very many → Score: 0

- **idx_24:**

---

**Criterion:**

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.

In all responses, the given response is the same:

`adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton`

  Perfect match → Score: 1

- **idx_1:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

- **idx_25:**  
  Target: michaelbublé, gwenstefani, rebamcentire, snoopdogg

### Summary:

Only responses exactly matching the target or roughly pointing to the same artists in the standard target receive 1. Others receive 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

```",carsondaly,carsondaly,0.0,"Analysis:

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

---

**Criterion:**

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.

### Breakdown by idx:

- **idx_0:**  
  Target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Perfect match → Score: 1

- **idx_1:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

- **idx_2:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

- **idx_3:**

  Response contains ceelogreen, christinaaguilera not in target, and misses gwen, pharrell. Not same entities → Score: 0

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams  
  No word-for-word needed, but ceelo and pharrell are different artists → Score: 0

- **idx_8:**  
  Target: adamlevine, gwenstefani, pharrellwilliams, blakeshelton  
  Same as idx_6 → Score: 0

- **idx_9:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton

  Response has ceelogreen, christinaaguilera instead of mileycyrus, aliciakeys. Different artists → Score: 0

- **idx_11:**  
  Target: adamlevine, gwenstefani, aliciakeys, blakeshelton  
  Response differs (ceelogreen, christinaaguilera) vs (gwenstefani, aliciakeys) → Score: 0

- **idx_12:**

  Response differs → Score: 0

- **idx_13:**  
  Target: adamlevine, aliciakeys, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton  
  Response differs → Score: 0

- **idx_14:**  
  Target: adamlevine, kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson, blakeshelton, kelseaballerini(comebackstage)  
  Response lacks kellyclarkson, jenniferhudson. Also the comeback stage person can be ignored.  
  But response still misses kelly and jennifer → Score: 0

- **idx_15:**  
  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**  
  Target: kellyclarkson, gwenstefani, johnlegend, blakeshelton  
  Response misses all except blakeshelton → Score: 0

- **idx_17:**

  Response misses all except blakeshelton → Score: 0

- **idx_21:**

  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_22:**

  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_23:**  
  Target: johnlegend, gwenstefani, niallhoran, rebamcentire, dan+shay(guest)  
  Guests/comeback ignored, still response misses very many → Score: 0

- **idx_24:**  
  Target: johnlegend, dan+shay, chancetherapper, rebamcentire  
  Response misses → Score: 0

- **idx_25:**  
  Target: michaelbublé, gwenstefani, rebamcentire, snoopdogg  
  Response misses → Score: 0

  Perfect match → Score: 1

- **idx_1:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

- **idx_2:**  
  Same as idx_0 → Score: 1

- **idx_7:**  
  Target: adamlevine, pharrellwilliams, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response contains ceelogreen instead of pharrellwilliams  
  The only mismatch is ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams

  Target: adamlevine, johnlegend, kellyclarkson, blakeshelton, beberexha(comebackstage)  
  Same reasoning: response misses johnlegend, kellyclarkson → Score: 0

- **idx_16:**

  Guests/comeback ignored, still response misses very many → Score: 0

- **idx_24:**

- **idx_25:**  
  Target: michaelbublé, gwenstefani, rebamcentire, snoopdogg

### Summary:

Only responses exactly matching the target or roughly pointing to the same artists in the standard target receive 1. Others receive 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

```",carsondaly,carsondaly,0.0,"Analysis:

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.

The key point is that ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In all pairs, the response is ""carsondaly.""

- For those targets that are exactly ""carsondaly,"" the response matches the entity perfectly → score = 1.

- For those targets that are ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)"" or ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia),"" the response only mentions ""carsondaly"" but omits the additional entity/entities.

The question is: does ""carsondaly"" alone sufficiently answer the target which includes multiple entities?

Given the criterion, the response points to the same entity ""carsondaly"" but omits the other(s). So the response only partially matches.

The criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" So the response only points to one of the two or more entities.

Is that enough to give a 1?

The phrase ""if they point to the same entity"" implies that mentioning the same entity contained in the target suffices.

Therefore, if the target contains ""carsondaly"" plus others, the response ""carsondaly"" points to the entity ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target.

So it satisfies the criterion to score 1.

So for idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3:

- response: carsondaly

- target includes carsondaly plus other entities

However, since the response points to the entity ""carsondaly"" (which is in the target), it is sufficient.

Hence, score = 1.

For idx_4 to idx_25:

- response = ""carsondaly""

- target = ""carsondaly""

Perfect match → score = 1.

Conclusion: All scores = 1.

```",carsondaly,carsondaly,0.0,"Analysis:

- The criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact match.

- Here, each idx pair links a ""response"" and a ""target.""

- For all idx from 0 to 25:
  - The response is ""nan""
  - The target is either ""nan"" or a proper string entity (e.g., ""chrismartin"", ""taylorswift"", etc.)

- The pairs where both response and target are ""nan"" (e.g., idx_0, idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, idx_4, idx_13, idx_21) imply that the response semantically matches the target (both missing or no answer).

- For pairs where response is ""nan"" but the target is a valid entity (e.g., idx_5 to idx_25 except idx_13 and idx_21), the response does not match the target semantically or refer to the same entity.

- According to the criterion, response ""nan"" vs target entity: no semantic equivalence; score = 0

- response ""nan"" vs target ""nan"": semantic equivalence; score = 1

- The score is 1 if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if the response points to the same entity.
- If the reference answer provides multiple pieces of music, all pieces must be included in the response for a full score.
- The score is 0 if any piece is missing or incorrect.
- The response for every idx here is ""nan"" which is clearly not matching any part of the target answer (songs).
- Each response will be compared to its corresponding target.
- Since each response is ""nan,"" meaning no answer or no valid content, none of them includes the required songs.
- Therefore, all pairs get a 0 score.

Now, scoring each idx from 0 to 25:

- response is ""nan""
- target is multiple song titles in format song(type), etc.
- No matching songs at all.

Hence, all responses score 0.
