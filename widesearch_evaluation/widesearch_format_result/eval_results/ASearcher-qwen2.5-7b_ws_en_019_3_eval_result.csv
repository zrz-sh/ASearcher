cgoncology,CG Oncology,,,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion.

Criterion:  
- Semantics approximately same or point to the same entity is sufficient.  
- No need for word-for-word match.

Analysis:

- idx_0: response ""cgon"" vs target ""cgon""  
  Exact match → score 1

- idx_1: response ""zbio"" vs target ""zbio""  
  Exact match → score 1

- idx_2: response ""upb"" vs target ""upb""

- idx_3: response ""mbx"" vs target ""mbx""

- idx_4: response ""mgx"" vs target ""mgx""
