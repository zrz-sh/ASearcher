brazil,Brazil,,,2016rioolympics,2016 Rio Olympics,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze the provided pair:

**Standard Answer (idx_0):**  
""judo, athletics, boxing, sailing, volleyball(2), football""

**Response (idx_0):**  
""basketball(2), athletics(2), fencing(1), wrestling(1)""

**Analysis:**

- The criterion states that it's sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or they point to the same entity.
- The standard answer includes these sports: judo, athletics, boxing, sailing, volleyball, football.
- The response includes basketball, athletics, fencing, wrestling.
- Comparing each item:  
  - Athletics appears in both → match  
  - The other sports in the response (basketball, fencing, wrestling) do not appear in the standard answer.  
  - The standard answer contains judo, boxing, sailing, volleyball, football, none of which appear in the response.

- The overlap is just ""athletics"" in both, but there are more discrepancies than matches.
- Since the criterion allows approximate semantic match or pointing to the same entity, the presence of only one matching item out of many isn't likely enough for a fully correct answer.
- However, the instructions specify scores are either 0 or 1 (no partial credit). So, if the response captures the main idea (the set of sports) and some overlap, that may suffice for 1, otherwise 0.

Given that only 1 out of 6 standard sports is present, and the rest differ, I judge this response as incorrect because it does not approximately convey the same list as the standard answer or point to the same entities sufficiently.

**Final score for idx_0: 0**
