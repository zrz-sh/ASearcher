Criterion summary: The semantics of the response should be approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity. Word-for-word match is not necessary.

**idx_0**:  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""monterey""  
Analysis: ""nan"" (typically meaning ""not a number"" or no valid response) does not point to the same entity, nor does it have the same semantic meaning as ""monterey"". This does not fulfill the criterion.  
Score: 0

**idx_1**:  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""monterey""  
Analysis: Same as above. The response is ""nan"" which is not semantically the same as ""monterey"" and does not represent the same entity.
