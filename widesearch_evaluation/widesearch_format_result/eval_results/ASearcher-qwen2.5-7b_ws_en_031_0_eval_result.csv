- Typically, when target is nan, if response is also nan, score 1 (they match). If response is non-nan but target is nan, probably score 0 (response gave something where none expected).

- **Response:** ""wongoldenglobe""  
- **Target:**  
  1. globalnonviolentfilmfestival：bestleadactress  
  2. heartlandfilmfestival：trulymovingpictureaward  
  3. cineuphoriaawards：bestactress–internationalcompetition  

- Analysis: The response indicates ""wongoldenglobe"" (Won Golden Globe). The target lists 3 different awards not including ""Golden Globe"". So they do NOT point to the same entities or semantically match.  
- Score: 0

### idx_3  
- **Response:** ""nominatedforgoldenglobe"" (nominated for Golden Globe)  
- **Target:** ""nan"" (no target)  
- Analysis: With no target, the response can't be evaluated as correct or incorrect. But since target is nan, presumably no answer was expected.  
- Typically, when target is nan, if response is also nan, score 1 (they match). If response is non-nan but target is nan, probably score 0 (response gave something where none expected).  
- Score: 0

### idx_4  
- **Response:** ""nan""  
- **Target:** ""nan""  
- Analysis: Both are nan, so they semantically match (both no answer).  
- Score: 1

### idx_5  
- **Response:** ""nominatedforbafta""  
- **Target:** ""nan""  
- Analysis: Same as idx_3: target is nan, response gives something. According to logic above, score 0.  
- Score: 0

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

  Target: ""becca""  
  Analysis: Exact match. Score = 1

- **idx_3**  
  Response: ""pilartucci""

  Response: ""angiedickinson""  
  Target: ""angiedickinson""  
  Analysis: Exact match. Score = 1

- **idx_5**  
  Response: ""ladymarion""  
  Target: ""marionloxley""  
  Analysis: Different forms of a name: ""Lady Marion"" vs. ""Marion Loxley"". This likely refers to the same character. Approximate semantics count. Score = 1
