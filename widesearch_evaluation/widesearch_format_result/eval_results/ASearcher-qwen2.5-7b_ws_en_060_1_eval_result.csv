Criterion:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word-for-word correspondence.

### Analysis:

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""garenainternational""  
- Target: ""tencent""  
- Analysis: ""garenainternational"" is a different entity/company from ""tencent."" They are both game companies but are not the same.

- Target: ""tencent""  
- Analysis: ""Tencent Games"" is a subsidiary or division of Tencent, so it points to the same larger entity (Tencent). The semantics correspond sufficiently as per criterion.  
- Verdict: Same entity → score 1
