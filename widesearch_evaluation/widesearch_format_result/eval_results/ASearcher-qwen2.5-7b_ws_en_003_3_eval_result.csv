Standard answer for all:
- target: ""olympics""

Responses for all:
- response: ""olympic""

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Semantic equivalence:
   - The target is ""olympics"" (plural noun referring to the Olympic Games).
   - The response is ""olympic"" (adjective or singular form).
   - The question is likely about naming the competition/event.
   - Although ""olympic"" is an adjective or relates to the Olympics, it does not fully name the event correctly.
   - However, the grading criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.""
   - ""olympic"" clearly refers to the Olympics, hence points to the same entity.
   
2. No requirement of word-for-word:
   - ""olympic"" vs ""olympics"" is a minor difference.
   - According to the criterion, this is acceptable.

Therefore, each response semantically corresponds to the same entity as the target, meeting the criteria for a full score.

Final scoring:

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""1st""  
- Target: ""goldmedal""  
Analysis: ""1st"" corresponds to first place, which is traditionally associated with a gold medal. The semantics match sufficiently.

- Target: ""goldmedal""  
Analysis: Same as idx_0. The semantics are consistent.

- No need for verbatim match if the meaning or entity match.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""chloekim,annagasser,michellekwan""
