**Pair idx_0**  
- Response: ""032024""  
- Target: ""september2024""

Analysis:  
- Response ""032024"" apparently stands for ""03/2024,"" which corresponds to March 2024.  
- Target is ""september2024,"" which is September 2024.  
- These are two different months in the same year. They do not point to the same entity (different months).  
- Semantics not approximately the same.

Analysis:  
- The numbers do not overlap; they refer to completely different ranges.  
- The response does not point to the same entity or similar semantics as the target.
