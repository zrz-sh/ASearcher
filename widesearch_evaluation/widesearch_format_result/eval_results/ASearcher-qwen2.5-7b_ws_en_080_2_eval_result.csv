brazil,Brazil,,,2024parisolympics,2024 Paris Olympics,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- The response is scored 1 if its semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity (the same set or at least overlap in the entities).  
- No need for exact word matching, but the response should reflect the target answer entities semantically or by entity matching.  
- Score only 0 or 1.

**idx_0**  
- Target: ""judo,gymnastics,volleyball""  
- Response: ""football(2)""  
- Analysis: The response mentions ""football,"" which is not in the target list (judo, gymnastics, volleyball). These sports are different categories. No overlap or semantic equivalence.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Target: ""judo,gymnastics,volleyball""  
- Response: ""athletics(2),basketball(1)""  
- Analysis: Response sports ""athletics"" and ""basketball"" do not match or correspond to any in the target list (judo, gymnastics, volleyball). No overlap or semantic equivalence here.  
- Score: 0

- Target: ""athletics""  
- Response: ""boxing(1)""  
- Analysis: Boxing is a different sport category from athletics. They are not semantically the same nor the same entity. So no match.
