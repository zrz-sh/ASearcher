### idx_0

- **Target:**  
  March to October: 09:00-18:00  
  Saturday: 09:00-20:00  
- **Response:**  
  10:00-18:00

**Analysis:**  
- The response gives a time range (10:00-18:00) which overlaps partially with the reference’s stated 09:00-18:00.  
- The reference mentions 09:00 as the start time, response has 10:00. Starting an hour later is not fully consistent, but the closing time is the same 18:00.  
- The reference includes March to October and Saturdays’ extended hours, but the criterion states closure dates and additional info are not necessary. So omission is acceptable.  
- Semantics: The reference is more specific, giving exact open hours by month and day, while the response broadens it to just a range that is slightly shifted.  
- Because the start time differs (09:00 vs 10:00), it is not exactly the same and might be interpreted as less precise or incorrect.  
- The criterion says it’s sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same. Here, the difference between 09:00 and 10:00 may reflect a meaningful deviation in opening hours. This might cause an issue because the response is not inclusive or fully consistent with the reference time.  
- Because the response states 10:00 (starting an hour later), it is not the same as 09:00. The semantics differ meaningfully.

**Conclusion:** Score 0 (not fully correct).

---

### idx_1

- **Target:**  
  10:00-18:00 (until 21:00 on Wednesdays and Saturdays)  
- **Response:**  
  mon/tue/thu/fri/sun:10:00~18:00; wed/sat:10:00~21:00

**Analysis:**  
- The response specifies the same times as the target.  
- The distribution of times across the week matches perfectly: 10:00-18:00 on most days, extended on Wed & Sat to 21:00.  
- The response includes exact days and times consistent with the target, which only says “until 21:00 on Wed and Sat” without specifying other days but implying regular 10:00-18:00 hours.  
- The criterion says semantics only need to be approximately the same and not necessarily word-for-word. Here, this matches exactly or is even more detailed.  
- No discrepancy is found.

**Conclusion:** Score 1 (fully correct).

### idx_2

- **Target:**  
  Tuesday to Sunday: 10:00–19:00

- The criterion allows approximate semantic equivalency and here it is a perfect match.
