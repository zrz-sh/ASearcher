- Response: ""carrédeschamps-élysées-8avenuedutuit,75008paris""  
- Target: ""8av.dutuit,75008paris""  
Analysis:  
- The target mentions ""8av.dutuit"" in postal code 75008 Paris.  
- The response adds ""carrédeschamps-élysées"" before ""8avenuedutuit"".  
- The key element is the address ""8 avenue du Tuit"" (or a close variant). ""carre des champs-élysées"" is an additional place descriptor but does not negate the fact that the main address is present.  
- Since both mention the same address (8 avenue du Tuit) and postal code 75008 Paris, this is semantically equivalent.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""moderncuisine""  
- Target: ""refinedfrenchclassicwithmorderntechniques""

Analysis:  
The target answer describes a refined French classic cuisine with modern techniques. The response is ""moderncuisine"". While the response captures the ""modern"" element, it misses the ""refined classic French"" part. However, since the grading criterion states it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, and partial matching is acceptable as long as relevant, it is somewhat related but less complete. However, ""moderncuisine"" alone does not capture ""refined"" or ""classic"" elements of the target. It is relevant but incomplete.

Verdict: Given the looseness allowed (approximate semantics and relevance), this counts as sufficient relevance, so score = 1.

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""classicfrench""  
- Target: ""timelessfrenchhautecuisine""

Analysis:  
""Timeless French haute cuisine"" and ""classic French"" are strongly related concepts. Haute cuisine denotes high-quality classic French cooking, and ""classic French"" refers essentially to the same entity from a semantic perspective.

Verdict: Approximate semantic equivalence holds, so score = 1.

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""moderncuisine""  
- Target: ""contemporaryfrench""

Analysis:  
""Modern"" and ""contemporary"" are synonyms, and ""moderncuisine"" and ""contemporaryfrench"" refer to basically the same concept—modern style French cooking.

Verdict: Semantics approximately the same, so score = 1.

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""contemporaryfrench""  
- Target: ""artisticfrenchwithsauce-centricdishes""

Analysis:  
The target emphasizes artistic French cuisine with sauce-centric dishes; the response is simply ""contemporary French."" While artistic and sauce-centric elements are not explicitly stated in the response, ""contemporary French"" is relevant to French cuisine and could cover artistic and modern styles. Given the criteria of approximate semantic relevance and no need for word-for-word or one-to-one matching, this should be acceptable.
