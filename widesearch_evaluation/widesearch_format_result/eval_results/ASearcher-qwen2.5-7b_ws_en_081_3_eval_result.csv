baldur'sgate3,Baldur's Gate 3,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step based on the given criterion:

Criterion summary:
- Semantics approximately the same as the reference or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- No need for exact word-for-word match.

---

**idx_0**  
- response: ""nan""  
- target: ""nan""  
Analysis: Both are identical and correspond semantically (both are ""nan""). So the semantics are the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- response: ""nan""  
- target: ""armoredcorevi:firesofrubicon""  
Analysis: The response is ""nan"", but the target is a specific identifier (""armoredcorevi:firesofrubicon"") which points to an entity. The response does not carry the same semantics or refer to the same entity, so it is not sufficient.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- response: ""nan""  
- target: ""nan""  
Analysis: As with idx_0, both are ""nan"", so semantics approximately same.  
Score: 1
