```",stickseason,arianagrande,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Matching one or more from the reference (target) is sufficient to get full credit (score 1).  
- A few extra items in the response that are not in the target are allowed as long as at least one matches.  
- If no overlap, score 0.

Criterion summary:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.  
- Main body consistency is key; presence or absence of ""feat xx"" or ""with xx"" is acceptable.

**idx_0:**  
response = ""espresso""  
target = ""espresso""  
Exact match → score: 1

**idx_1:**  
response = ""beautifulthings""  
target = ""beautifulthings""  
Exact match → score: 1

**idx_2:**  
response = ""birdsofafeather""  
target = ""birdsofafeather""  
Exact match → score: 1

**idx_3:**  
response = ""gata""  
target = ""gataonly""  
Main body: ""gata"" vs ""gataonly""  
- The response is a substring of the target.  
- Per the criterion, main body consistency is needed. ""gata"" vs. ""gataonly"" - these can be interpreted as different titles unless ""gataonly"" is one word or ""gata"" and ""gataonly"" are different entities.  
- Since ""gata"" is not the full title, and they differ, this is considered unmatched. Score: 0

**idx_4:**  
response = ""diewithasmile""
