- Target answer: ""yg""
- Response: ""ygentertainment""

Criterion says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

""YG"" is an abbreviation that often stands for ""YG Entertainment,"" a South Korean entertainment company. The response ""ygentertainment"" explicitly refers to the full name of the entity that ""yg"" abbreviates.

The semantics are the same; the response actually provides a more complete name than the target.

Therefore, the response correctly points to the same entity. According to the criterion, this answer is sufficient.

Score: 1

```json
{
  ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",yg,ygentertainment,1.0,"To score idx_0:

- Reference answer: ""blackpink""
- Response: ""blackpink""
- Analysis: The response exactly matches the reference answer. According to the criterion, exact match or approximate semantics is sufficient. Here it is identical.
- Conclusion: Score = 1

```json
{
  ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",blackpink,blackpink,1.0,"Let's analyze the single pair provided:

- idx_0:

  - Target answer: ""whistle（휘파람）\nboombayah（붐바야）""

    This shows two song titles: ""whistle"" and ""boombayah"", with Korean characters in parentheses indicating the original language titles.

  - Response: ""whistle,boombayah,...""

    The response lists ""whistle, boombayah"" followed by ""..."" which likely indicates continuation or omitted content.

  - According to the criterion:

    - The main part of the song title (""whistle"" and ""boombayah"") must be consistent.

    - Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entities is sufficient.

    - Additional identifiers are ignored.

  - The response contains both ""whistle"" and ""boombayah"" clearly.

  - No other keywords or modifiers affect correctness.

  - Ellipsis ""..."" indicates incomplete, but since the requirement is not about completeness but correctness of the given part and semantic consistency, it does not reduce the score.

  - Overall, the response correctly conveys the main song titles matching the target.

**Final judgment:** score = 1 (completely correct)
