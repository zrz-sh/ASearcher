**Given:**

- Target (standard answer): ""judo,sailing,hockey""
- Response: ""athletics(3),basketball(1),boxing(2),fencing(1),gymnastics(1),shooting(2),swimming(2),tennis(1)""

**Step 1: Understand the task**

The standard answer lists ""judo"", ""sailing"", and ""hockey"". The response lists multiple sports that are completely different from the target.

**Step 2: Check the similarity between response and target**

- The response lists athletics, basketball, boxing, fencing, gymnastics, shooting, swimming, tennis
- None of these match or point to the same entities as ""judo"", ""sailing"", or ""hockey"".
- According to the criterion, it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Here, there is no semantic similarity or match.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

- The response does not cover or align with the target answers.
- It should be scored 0 (incorrect).
