,,thetourist,The Tourist,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair step-by-step with the given criteria:

- Criterion: Semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, no need for exact word-for-word match.

1. idx_0:  
   Response: ""angelinajolie""  
   Target: ""angelinajolie""  
   They are exactly the same, clearly referring to the same entity. Score = 1.

2. idx_1:  
   Response: ""nicolekidman""  
   Target: ""nicolekidman""  
   Exactly the same, also same entity. Score = 1.

3. idx_2:  
   Response: ""cateblanchett""  
   Target: ""cateblanchett""  
   Exactly the same, same entity. Score = 1.

---

### idx_0
- **Response:** ""nan""
- **Target:** ""teenchoiceawards-choicemovieactress:action""
- **Analysis:** The target is a specific named entity (a particular award name). The response is ""nan"" (not a valid or meaningful answer).
- **Judgment:** The response does not approximate or point to the same entity as the reference answer.
- **Score:** 0

---

### idx_1

- **Target:** 
  ```
  1.globalnonviolentfilmfestival：bestleadactress
  2.heartlandfilmfestival：trulymovingpictureaward
  3.cineuphoriaawards：bestactress–internationalcompetition
  ```
- **Analysis:** The target lists three different award names. The response is ""nan"".
- **Judgment:** The response clearly does not approximate or point to the same entities as the reference answers.
- **Score:** 0

---

### idx_2
- **Response:** ""nan""
- **Target:** ""nan""
- **Analysis:** Both the response and target are ""nan"".
- **Judgment:** Since both are identical (both ""nan""), they refer to the same ""entity"" or lack thereof. According to the criterion, approximate equivalence suffices.
- **Score:** 1

```",teenchoiceawards-choicemovieactress:action,nan,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the grading criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Exact match not required, but should relate clearly to the same entity.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""eliseclifton""  
- Target: ""eliseclifton-ward""  
Analysis:  
- The response is a partial name: it's ""eliseclifton"" vs ""eliseclifton-ward"".  
- These strings differ; the target includes ""-ward"".  
- Are they the same entity? Possibly, ""eliseclifton"" may be a shortened form of ""eliseclifton-ward"".  
- Without further context, we can reasonably assume these refer to the same person (the difference is a suffix). The criterion allows semantic similarity with approximate match.  
- So this should be scored as 1.

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""becca""  
- Target: ""becca""  
Analysis:  
- Exact match, no difference.  
- Score: 1.

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""ladymarion""  
- Target: ""marionloxley""  
Analysis:  
- Response includes ""lady"" as a prefix; target includes ""marionloxley"".  
- Names differ: ""ladymarion"" (likely ""Lady Marion"") vs ""Marion Loxley"".  
- They appear to reference the same entity known as ""Marion Loxley"" or ""Lady Marion"", i.e., likely the same character.  
- The criterion states that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Therefore, score: 1.
