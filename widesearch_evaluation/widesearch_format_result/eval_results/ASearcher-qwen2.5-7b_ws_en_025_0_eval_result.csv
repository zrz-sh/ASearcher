fpawomen'shealth-fresno,FPA Women's Health,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"exact match, response: fresno, target: fresno",fresno,fresno,1.0,"Let's analyze the provided pair according to the criterion:

- Standard answer: ""165northclarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""
- Response: ""165n.clarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Semantics:
   - Both answers provide an address.
   - ""165northclarkstreet"" vs ""165n.clarkstreet"" indicates the same street with ""north"" abbreviated as ""n.""
   - The rest ""fresno, ca 93701"" is identical, ignoring case and spacing/punctuation.

2. Criterion states that approximate semantic equivalence is sufficient, no need for word-for-word match.

3. The response points clearly to the same address/entity.

Therefore, according to the criterion, this response is correct and should receive a score of 1.

- idx_0:
  - Standard answer: ""closed""
  - Response: ""closed""
  - The semantics are exactly the same, and the response matches the target exactly.

Given the criterion that the semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity and since the response is exactly the same, this should be scored as 1.

Final scoring results:
