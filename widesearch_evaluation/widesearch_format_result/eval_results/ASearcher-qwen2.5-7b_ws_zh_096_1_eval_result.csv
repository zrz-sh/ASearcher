The response can have different wording or format, as long as the meaning is generally the same or the entities pointed to are consistent.

- Target:  
  - 第53届戛纳国际电影节最佳男演员 (Best Actor at the 53rd Cannes Film Festival)  
  - 第20届香港电影金像奖最佳男主角 (Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 20th Hong Kong Film Awards)  
  - 第1届华语电影传媒大奖最佳男主角 (Best Actor at the 1st Chinese-language Film Media Awards)  

- Response: ""bestactorinaleadingrole(hongkongfilmawards)""  
- The response only corresponds to the second item in the target: Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor in a Leading Role. It ignores the other two awards.  
- The criterion says roughly matched is OK. The response identifies one correct award from the target. Having partial correctness is allowed if the meaning matches. But the response only mentions one award, missing others.  
- However, the grading is binary: 0 or 1, and the criterion allows approximate equivalence (not word-by-word). Here, the response is consistent with part of the target but not fully. The question is: is partially correct enough for 1, or does it need to cover all? The criterion says ""semantically similar or pointing to the same entities,"" so partial coverage of entities can still be considered correct if the essential meaning is preserved.

Here, the response mentions ""bestactorinaleadingrole(hongkongfilmawards)"" which corresponds exactly to one of the target awards. The response does not mention the Cannes award or the Chinese-language Film Media Award. But the response is not contradictory or irrelevant, and the entity is among those in the target.

Given that partial mention is consistent and no contradictory info, and since the response points to one of the awards exactly, we can consider it correct.

- Response: ""bestactorinaleadingrole(hongkongfilmawards)""  
- The response corresponds to the Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor, which matches the first award in the target.  
- The response does not mention the Golden Horse Award, but again partial overlap to the target is present, so from the criterion, this is acceptable.  
- Thus, the response is semantically consistent with the target.
