- response: ""wongkar-wai""  
- target: ""karwaiwong""  
Same as idx_0, same entity. Score = 1

---

**idx_2**  
- response: ""anglee""  
- target: ""anglee""  
Exact match. Score = 1

---

**idx_3**  
- response: ""wongkar-wai""  
- target: ""karwaiwong""  
Same as idx_0 and idx_1, same entity. Score = 1

---

**idx_4**  
- response: ""chenger""  
- target: ""ercheng""  
These look like rearranged or misspelled forms of a name. However, it is unlikely that ""chenger"" and ""ercheng"" refer to the same entity because the ordering of letters and syllables do not closely match. Unless they are variants of the same name, but judging by the provided info only, we must reject. They do not sufficiently point to the same entity. Score = 0

---

**idx_5**  
- response: ""anthonylau""  
- target: ""felixchong""  
Clearly two different names; no semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity. Score = 0

Criterion summary:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word match.

### idx_0  
**Response:** ""usafilms""  
**Target:** ""block2pictures(hongkong)\nocéanfilms(france)""
