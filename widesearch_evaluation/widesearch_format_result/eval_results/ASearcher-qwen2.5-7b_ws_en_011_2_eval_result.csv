The response exactly matches the target. This is a perfect match, so score = 1.

The target allows for two possible answers: ""fwd"" or ""awd"". The response is ""fwd"", which is one of the entities listed in the target.

Since the response points to the same entity as part of the acceptable answers, it is sufficient.
