,,arts&humanities,Arts & Humanities,harvarduniversity,Harvard University,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the grading criteria:

- Criterion: The month and day must be correct.
- The response must have semantics approx. the same or point to the same entity as the target.

All responses are ""rolling"" which is a word describing a type of schedule, usually continuous or ongoing, and do not specify any month or day.

The targets are specific dates or datetime:
- idx_0: january1  
- idx_1: october15,6pm(bst)  
- idx_2: oct15  
- idx_3: january6  
- idx_4: october15,6pm(bst)  
- idx_5: january5  
- idx_6: january1  
- idx_7: january5  
- idx_8: january6

Responses provide no month or day information. So they do not meet the requirement of correct month and day or an approximate same semantics referring to the exact date.

Hence, for all pairs, responses do not provide the required date info.

**Conclusion:** All scores are 0.

,,socialsciences&management,Business and Economics,harvarduniversity,Harvard University,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the grading criteria:

- Criterion: The month and day must be correct.
- The response must have semantics approx. the same or point to the same entity as the target.

All responses are ""rolling"" which is a word describing a type of schedule, usually continuous or ongoing, and do not specify any month or day.

The targets are specific dates or datetime:
- idx_0: january1  
- idx_1: october15,6pm(bst)  
- idx_2: oct15  
- idx_3: january6  
- idx_4: october15,6pm(bst)  
- idx_5: january5  
- idx_6: january1  
- idx_7: january5  
- idx_8: january6

Responses provide no month or day information. So they do not meet the requirement of correct month and day or an approximate same semantics referring to the exact date.

Hence, for all pairs, responses do not provide the required date info.

**Conclusion:** All scores are 0.
