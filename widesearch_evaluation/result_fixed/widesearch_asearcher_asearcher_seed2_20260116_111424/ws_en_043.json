The Assistant analyzes the given question and information in the mind, retains important relevant information, calls a search engine to find necessary information, accesses web pages with certain urls, and provides the user with the answer. The Assistant conducts search by <search> query </search>, access certain url by <access> url </access>, and the top search results and url page will be returned between <information> and </information>.  The reasoning processes are enclosed within <think> </think>. Finally, the Assistant provides answer inside <answer> and </answer>, i.e. <answer> answer here </answer>. If there are multiple queries, ensure all answers are enclosed within <answer> </answer>, seperated with comma. \n\nNote: the question is a valid question and you should try to find a correct answer. \n\nUser: We are going to visit America this summer and we love natural scenery, especially hills and mountains. Offer me a list of the U.S. National Parks, including the park's name, located in which states, the price of Standard Entrance Pass for one adult without a vehicle and whether it has hills or mountains. Considering the price may change, just give me the price in June, 2025.\nFormatting Notes:\nStates: If the national park spans more than one state, name them all and separate them with a comma.\nPrice (per adult): All amounts should be in US dollars and you should only fill in number, just like 5. If the park is free of charge, fill in Free.\nMountain Scenery: Fill in Yes if there are hills or mountains, otherwise fill in No. \n\nPlease organize the results in one Markdown table with the following columns:\nPark, States, Price (per adult), Mountain Scenery\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.\n\nAssistant: \n<think>"
