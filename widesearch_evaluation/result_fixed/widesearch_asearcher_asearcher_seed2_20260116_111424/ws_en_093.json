The reasoning processes are enclosed within <think> </think>. Finally, the Assistant provides answer inside <answer> and </answer>, i.e. <answer> answer here </answer>. If there are multiple queries, ensure all answers are enclosed within <answer> </answer>, seperated with comma. \n\nNote: the question is a valid question and you should try to find a correct answer. \n\nUser: I want to catch up with the current large language model trends, so I need to quickly learn about them. Please help me compile a list of LLM-related papers officially published by Doubao Seed Team from Bytedance and DeepSeek from 2023 to the first half of 2025. The list should include: Publication date (in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2024-02-01), Paper title (in original English as published), and authors. By the way, I only want papers published independently by Doubao Seed Team from Bytedance and the DeepSeek team, not collaborative papers.\n\nPlease output the compiled data in Markdown table format.\n The column headers should be:\nCompany Name, Publication Date, Paper Title, Authors.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is:\n```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.\n\nAssistant: \n<think>"
