I’d like to know what rap-related categories have been awarded at the Grammys over the past 30 years, and for each winning entry, I need the following information: Award Category, Winning Song/Album, Performer(s) (including featured artists, listed in the official order—e.g., Killer Mike (ft. André 3000, Future & Eryn Allen Kane)). Please provide a complete list based on official Grammy records.\n\nPlease present the organized data in one Markdown table format.\nThe column headers should be, in order:\nAnnual, Award Category, Winning Song/Album, Performer(s).\nFor the 62nd annual award, just output 62 in the column of \"Annual\".\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.\n\nAssistant: \n<think>"
