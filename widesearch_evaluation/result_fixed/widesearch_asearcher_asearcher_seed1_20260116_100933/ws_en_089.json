If the launch price or key new feature cannot be confirmed, leave that field blank in the table.\n\nPlease output the sorted data in the format of one Markdown table. The column names in the table are: Product, Launch Year, Capacity, Launch Price (USD), Core New Technologies/Features.\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.
